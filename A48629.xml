            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </note> principal Places; which haſtily a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened us out of this Repoſe: and ſcarce were our eyes opened, but divers Libells (the uſual fore-runners of War) were ſpred up and down promiſcuouſly amongſt the Nobility and Common people, to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
<pb facs="tcp:101549:3"/>his Majeſtie's faithful Subjects, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der colour of ſome Pretenſions of the moſt Chriſtian Queen upon all theſe Provinces. One whereof is entituled, <hi>A Dialogue on the Subject of the Rights of the moſt Chriſtian Queen.</hi> The next hath for Title, <hi>A Treatiſe of the Rights which the moſt Chriſtian Queen hath to ſundry Eſtates of the Monarchy of Spain.</hi> And the third goes by the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellation of <hi>Threeſcore and fourteen Reaſons, which prove as clear as the day, that the Renunciation made by the Queen of</hi> France <hi>is null,</hi> &amp;c. Theſe Pretenſions tend onely to ſap and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the foundation of the <hi>Pyrenean</hi> Treaty, by overthrowing the moſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Queen's Renunciation (which ſhe ſo ſolemnly ſwore to obſerve in favour both of the Peace and Marriage) of all Rights that might belong to her, and ſtretch themſelves to no leſs then the Dutchy of
<pb facs="tcp:101549:3"/>
               <hi>Brabant</hi> with its Appurtenances, the Seigniory of <hi>Machelen, Antwerp,</hi> the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per <hi>Gelderland, Namur, Limburg,</hi> and the united places beyond the River of <hi>Maes, Hainault, Artois, Cambray,</hi> the Free County of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> the Dutchy of <hi>Luxemburg,</hi> and one of the principal parts of the County of <hi>Flanders.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After I had curiouſly read over the Contents of theſe Libells, at firſt I could not be perſwaded that ſuch Writings were authorized by the Court of <hi>France,</hi> and looked upon them a great while as <hi>paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volants,</hi> and the effects of ſome idle Pens, which out of wantonneſſe affected to make themſelves remarkable by wittily maintaining a Paradox: and indeed their proceeding was too irregular, the matter too brittle, and the form too un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handſome, to believe with any ground of likelihood that they leaned upon publick Authority. For I ſuppoſed, and with
<pb facs="tcp:101549:4"/>Juſtice enough on my ſide, that what Pretenſions ſoever the moſt Chriſtian King could have upon a Prince united unto him by ſo many tyes of Kindred and Amity, he would never have begun by the way of Execution, and the exciting of his People to Rebellion; but that the voice of the Cannon ſhould have been the laſt made uſe of to plead his Cauſe, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving before made triall of all other means. This opinion was confirmed to me by the continual Aſſurances and poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive words which his moſt Chriſtian Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie hath often ſent to the Court of <hi>Spain</hi> by his<note n="*" place="margin">The Arch-biſhop of <hi>Ambrun.</hi>
               </note> Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor there, and by the<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador in <hi>France.</hi>
               </note> Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs <hi>de la Fuente,</hi> That no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſhould be able to hinder him from obſerving religiouſly the Peace. In which belief he ſtill fortified us by Propoſitions of Leagues, and of Mediation, and by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iterated Promiſes of an inviolable Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
<pb facs="tcp:101549:4"/>not ſparing any care to diſſipate all the Suſpicions which his powerful Arming might juſtly have made us conceive.</p>
            <p>Our own Conſciences alſo did oblige us not to doubt of the ſincerity of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of <hi>France,</hi> and the ſcrupulous care which we took to avoid the giving them any cauſe of diſpleaſure, even to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting (for their reſpect) the means which were offered us from all parts for our ſafety, gave us cauſe to believe, that ſuch a Comportment as this was, being ſo neat and obliging, ſhould not onely ſtop the effects of their Arms, by taking away all the Cauſes, but ſhould alſo have touched them with tenderneſs for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence of an Infant, a Couſin, and a Brother-in-Law, to let him paſs his younger years in the quiet of a Peace, which the King his Father had ſo dearly bought for him. And though the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours which <hi>France</hi> ſent from time to time
<pb facs="tcp:101549:5"/>into <hi>Portugall</hi> (and that too before they could pretend to the effect of this imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Devolution</hi>) were manifeſt diſcoveries, that the Faith of Treaties &amp; of Oaths were much inferiour to the Intereſt of State; yet we flattered our ſelves, that the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganimitie of our Patience might ſhelter us from receiving new injuries at their hands, by diſſembling our ſenſe of the firſt, and that they would be aſhamed to heap ſo many without interruption the one up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the other.</p>
            <p>But having heard that the ſame Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bells had been ſolemnly preſented by the<note n="*" place="margin">

               <hi>French</hi> Embaſſador to the States of the <hi>United Provinces,</hi> and to the Imperial Diet, and divers Princes of <hi>Germanie;</hi> I thought that I ſhould be wanting in all that I owe to my King, my Countrey, and the Publick, as well as to my ſelf, if I did not employ the little knowledge and light
<pb facs="tcp:101549:5"/>which God hath given me, towards the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval of the falſe Impreſſions which the artifice of a ſlight Eloquence, much more then the ſolidity of Reaſons, might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce in the opinion of credulous ſpirits, not throughly verſed in our Laws and Cuſtomes. Beſides, methought that I owed this Conſolation to the afflicted peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and this ſatisfaction to the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing States, to let them evidently under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that all the Pretexts with which the <hi>French</hi> do labour to diſguiſe the vaſt Deſigns that they have in hand, are but falſe colours to mask the true Spring which gives the Motion to this Machine, and to make an Ambition which goes at a great pace to the <hi>Univerſal Monarchie</hi> paſs under the veil of Juſtice.</p>
            <p>Which conſideration hath induced me ſeriouſly to weigh theſe Writings, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turely to examine all the Reaſons, Ends and Circumſtances of them: And after
<pb facs="tcp:101549:6"/>having carefully turned over all the Acts, (as much as the ſhortneſs of time and the confuſion of the preſent Troubles would give me leave) and examined the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Marriage,</hi> with the Act of <hi>Renunciation,</hi> and conſulted the moſt expert Civi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ians that are amongst us in the Practick and Cuſtomes of places; I found, without any preoccupation of minde, theſe Pretenſions not onely to be contrary to publick Right, to the Cuſtomes in Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Succeſsions, and the ſincere Faith of Treaties, which are made betwixt Crown and Crown for the Tranquillitie of the People, and the Conſervation of Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies; but even to that particular Right which regulates private Families, and thoſe Municipal Cuſtomes which every Nation doth preſcribe unto it ſelf, by the will or permiſsion, either expreſs or tacite, of their Sovereigns. I have beſides ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved ſo many evident Falſhoods in the
<pb facs="tcp:101549:6"/>matter of Fact, ſo many inſupportable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vectives againſt the Perſon of the<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>PHILIP</hi> the Fourth.</note> late King of moſt Glorious Memory, ſo great a number of malicious Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices to pervert the people, ſo many hyper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical Exaggerations to caſt duſt in the eyes of the neighbouring Princes, and ſo many pernicious Maxims, which draw a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long after them a train of Conſequences moſt dangerous for all Chriſtendome; that I had a great deal of difficultie to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive how people, who make profeſsion of Learning and Knowledge of the Affairs of the World, durſt expoſe to publick cenſure things ſo ill digeſted: which hath the more encouraged me to undertake this Work, by reaſon that I foreſee how much it imports, not to ſuffer a boldneſs (which ſo freely abuſes the patience of the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders) to paſs unchaſtiſed; and the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt which all States have in this Affair makes me aſſuredly believe, that I do plead
<pb facs="tcp:101549:7"/>in this the Cauſe of the whole World. It is, I confeſs, a matter of trouble to ſee my ſelf obliged to reduce to the terms of liti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious pleading a Difference between So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Princes, ſo ſolemnly decided by a publick Treatie, upon the Faith whereof all Chriſtendome did ſolely found their Quiet. But as a good Cauſe fears no Judge, nor a good Conſcience any kind of Cenſure; I will freely enter the Liſts, and ſhall be overjoyed to have as many Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of the Juſtice of our Cauſe, as there be reaſonable and diſintereſſed perſons in the World.</p>
            <p>Though we cannot doubt of the Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation which the moſt Chriſtian King hath given to thoſe injurious Writings, I cannot yet be perſuaded that he ever took the pains to reade them over, and will rather believe (to his honour) that his weighty Affairs, and his great application to this loftie Arming, have ſo taken up all his
<pb facs="tcp:101549:7"/>time, that he had none to ſpare to caſt his eyes upon works which have ſo little ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy with his Genius and Qualitie. It is much eaſier to believe, that truſting in this to the faith of others, he hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned himſelf to his natural propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to immortalize his name by Arms and Conqueſts, and to the Suggeſtions of thoſe who deſire nothing more then to ſee him incumbred abroad for their ſelf-ends. In effect he hath too much Generoſity, and Love for the Queen his Conſort, to ſuffer that any ſhould ſo unworthily defame the Reputation of his Father-in-Law; he is too much concerned in the common Cauſe of Kings, to endure that his Scribblers ſhould attempt upon Royal perſons; he hath too much Juſtice, to permit that they ſhould make the moſt tender Father and beſt of Kings paſs for a Tyrant, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining his Daughter, by a barbarous Disinheriting her, or a Cheater, who aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned
<pb facs="tcp:101549:8"/>her onely an Imaginary Portion; he hath too great a minde, to approve of tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling upon Jewels, or to deſire that an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt by way of Inventory ſhould be given him of all the Knacks which belonged to the Queen his Mother-in-Law, and that all the Earth ſhould be alarmed about a Domeſtick concernment, which the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the parties would decide without noiſe amongst mean Citizens: he knows that the Bounty of the King his Father-in-Law towards a Princeſs whom he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved more then himſelf did not reſtrain it ſelf to Notaries Clauſules; that both before and after the Marriage he ceaſed not to load her with his Benefits; and that he hath freely beſtowed his Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Dominions, to ſet upon her Head one of the faireſt Crowns in the World. In fine, he hath too much Prudence and love for Truth, ever to conſent to the publication of ſo many falſe Allegations
<pb facs="tcp:101549:8"/>ſo inconſiderately packed together one upon the back of another; not queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at all, but if that he had atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively conſidered them, they would have touched him with juſt indignation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe who have ſo impudently abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his Name, as to ingage maliciouſly his Reputation and his Arms in an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe ſo ill grounded.</p>
            <p>Which makes me hope that (having eſtabliſhed his Majeſtie's Rights upon un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable Foundations) the ſoliditie of our Reaſons will not onely conduce to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie the People, and perſwade the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour-Princes, but even pierce the heart of the moſt Chriſtian King; and that yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſtrength of their Evidence, he will reſolve henceforwards to propoſe juſter and more plauſible matters to hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſelf, whereby to make his Name famous, when in the unworthy Oppreſſion of a Pupill King; or at leaſt that he will contrive
<pb facs="tcp:101549:9"/>ſweeter and more honeſt ways in order to his full information. But if by ſecret Judgments of God we cannot obtain by this means that which we ought to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to our ſelves from the Prudence and the Equitie of ſo Great a King; I ſhall yet have this ſatisfaction, to have omitted no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing on my part that might contribute towards the diſſipation of this Tempeſt, which threatens all Chriſtendome; and having overcome by Reaſons, we hope that the Arbiter of Sovereigns and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Protector of Juſtice will not let us ſink under the weight of his Arms.</p>
            <p>To make fully known in the eye of the Sun the Deformitie and bad Connexion of thoſe ſeditious Writings, it would be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to anatomize them, and examine every piece apart. But as that deſign would engage me to a large Volume, and that time for the preſent is too precious; I have thought that it ſhould now ſuffice to
<pb facs="tcp:101549:9"/>collect onely the principal Points, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy their Grounds, and eſtabliſh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Foundations, and to goe (without ſtopping at a thouſand Superfluities, which they have alledged out of all ſeaſon onely to make the bulk of their Books bigger, and to embroil the minde of the Reader) directly to the ſubſtance and the heart of the Difficulty in queſtion. This ſhall be my endeavour; and in this I require in the Readers an attention void of intereſt, if yet they can be without intereſt in a Cauſe which ſo nearly toucheth them by an inevitable reflexion.</p>
            <p>Though I have propoſed to my ſelf in this Writing all the Moderation and Sweetneſſe which decency and inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on towards Peace doth require; yet the matter is of it ſelf ſo very ſharp, that it is almoſt impoſſible to give it a form that ſhall not participate of its roughne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſe. It's here intended to make the whole
<pb facs="tcp:101549:10"/>World ſee, That a War is unjuſt, the Ground of it ruinous, the Reaſons for it vain Pretexts; That the Apparences cover vaſt Deſigns; That the Allegations are falſe, the Proceedings violent, the Ends naught, and the Conſequences dangerous. The neceſſitie of a juſt Defence doth oblige us to bring to light all theſe Truths: and I defie the moſt dexterous Pens to be able to expreſs them in terms void of ſome Bitterneſs, or to apply the Razor to the bottome of the Wound without Pain to the Patient. I wiſh I were able to make things underſtood without naming them, and to colour them with obliging terms: but this cannot be done without deſtroying the Subſtance; and this Mask of words would paſs for a jearing ſhar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per then ſingle Expreſſions. I beſeech the Reader to be perſuaded that my onely drift is, to ſpeak of Things without touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Perſons; and if my Subject doth
<pb facs="tcp:101549:10"/>forcibly draw me into complaints and ſome reproches, I do here ſolemnly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt, That I pretend the moſt Chriſtian King's Sacred Perſon to be excepted; and that I do aſcribe all the Evils which are intended towards us onely to thoſe mean Incendiarie Writers, who, out of a deſire of Noveltie, and perhaps with purpoſes more dangerous to their own King then to ourſelves, have ſo lightly and unſeaſonably ſounded to horſe.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Of the Ends which FRANCE propoſeth unto it ſelf in this War, and in theſe Libells.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THE Author of theſe Libells employs a great deal more of care and art to colour the Deſigns of his Party, then to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh the Grounds of his imaginary Right. In this laſt his Pen is both dry
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:101549:13"/>and crawling: In the other it doth ſpread it ſelf with a pleaſant ſtream of words into a Thouſand ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous expreſſions, endeavouring as much as it can to preſent without diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very a falſe Light, hoping to change the Nature of things by changing on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly their Names. He extolls the love which his Maſter hath for Peace, at the very inſtant when he is breaking it; he complains at the ſame time when he ſtrikes; he takes away by violence, when he asks; he pleads and decides at once; he requires Peace, and brings War; attaques without Rupture, forces without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint, and plaies with ſo much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt upon the Ignorance and Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity which he ſuppoſes to be in the Judgment of his Readers, that he will needs have the way of Fact to paſs for Juſtice, Violence for Moderation, Uſurpation for Title, and Defence for a Crime: and ſo he can but onely take away the odious name of <hi>War</hi> from the Attempt which <hi>Frame</hi> is now making, he thinks that ſhe may
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:101549:13"/>freely practiſe all manner of Hoſtili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties under that of <hi>Peace:</hi> Which is the effect of the excellent opinion they have of the abilities of all other Nations, whom they eſteem bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous or ſimple enough to believe things of this nature, and afterwards glory in their jeſting, (according to their obliging cuſtome of turning into ridiculous the moſt Illuſtrious Nations) That they took us for <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This dull conceit tends evidently unto two Ends: The one, to extenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate a little the uglineſs of their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe, and the Scandal and Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion which they foreſee it will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce throughout all <hi>Europe:</hi> and that they may make all the cares which we ſhall take for our Defence paſs for as many Contraventions of the Peace; and by this means get ſome pretext whereby either they may preſs their Allies to joyn their Arms to theirs, in favour of their Deſign, or elſe may one of theſe daies bring the War upon themſelves, for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:101549:14"/>failed in performing the Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of their League of Warrantie. By which it is obvious to all ſorts of capacities, that the <hi>Abſolute Empire</hi> which they do equally affect over their Friends &amp; Enemies makes them act ſo Magiſterially both with the one and the other: So that to keep Peace with them, it is requiſite to give them all that they require; and to ſatisfie the Alliances made with them, it's neceſſary to help them to take all.</p>
               <p>But to judge of the injuſtice of this Pretenſion, it is ſufficient to read over the Treatie of <hi>the Peace of the Empire,</hi> in the Article of <hi>Warrantie,</hi> and that of the League of the <hi>Rhine:</hi> and then it will be clearly ſeen, that the Obligation of reciprocal Succours doth extend no farther then to thoſe Lands which <hi>France</hi> did poſſeſs in the Empire at the time when theſe Leagues were concluded; that they do not reach any new Conqueſts or Claims, and ought not to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood but againſt Aggreſſours: Elſe the Princes of the Empire had impoſed an
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:101549:14"/>horrible Servitude on themſelves, to be the Miniſters and Inſtruments of the Ambition of an Allie, to inlarge his Limits at the price of their bloud and of their own ſafetie, and to be bound to take arms into their hands as often as the Writers of <hi>France</hi> ſhould think fit to put their hand to the pen, to frame to their Crown ſome new Rights.</p>
               <p>It is not enough to underſtand the cunning of the Ends of their procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, but it concerns all the World to penetrate farther, even into the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of their Deſigns. If we will take it upon their faith, they have no other End but an honeſt Accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with <hi>Spain;</hi> They themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite Forreign Princes to intermeddle in it; They proteſt that they will ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer themſelves to be brought to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate Conditions, That they do make War againſt their ſtomachs, That they would lay down their arms with pleaſure, That they would ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit themſelves to the Judgement of thoſe who are willing to imploy their
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:101549:15"/>pains in it. Let us ſee then whether their behaviour doth ſuit with their words. —<hi>Spectemur agendo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All their Actions and Motions tend towards a vaſt and deep Deſign. This proud arming, this prodigious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, this exceſſive profuſion in their forreign Negotiations; this forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in making of Leagues, to gain Miniſters, to keep them in buſineſs who may give them jealouſie; the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iterated inſtances and the large offers which they have tendred to the <hi>Swedes</hi> to embroil the Empire; the extraordinary application to force the <hi>Polanders</hi> by corruption and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to chuſe a Succeſſor contrary to their Fundamental Laws; are proofs capable to convince the darkeſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings, that all this immenſe Preparation of Arms and Intrigues hath ſomething in it of greater extent then the bare Conqueſt of ſome Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, (which our over-much Credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity hath expoſed to them as a prey) and ends not in a ſimple deſire of tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away a few pieces of them by a
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:101549:15"/>Treatie. Theſe huge Mountains are not to bring forth Mice, but to vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit out Flames as the <hi>Veſuve,</hi> to ſet the whole neighbouring Countries on fire.</p>
               <p>The firſt<note n="*" place="margin">The Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Rodes.</hi>
                  </note> Governour of the moſt Chriſtian King hath given him for a Modell the Life and Deſigns of his Grandfather <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, as may be ſeen in the Book which he hath publiſhed. This Prince, as well by his own Genius, as by the happy ſucceſs of his firſt Undertakings, hath reliſhed ſuch Inſtructions, and hath ſolelie propoſed to himſelf this Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple for the Rule of his Actions. The Hiſtory of this Great King hath been his moſt ordinary ſtudy: He hath, in imitation of him, taken great care to accumulate much Treaſure, ſought for Alliances abroad, and at length hath raiſed moſt powerfull Armies. We muſt therefore conclude, that he acts upon the very ſame Draughts; and that all we ſee at preſent are but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed Projects, and the effects of thoſe Impreſſions which he hath ſuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in with his milk. To draw the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:101549:16"/>from theſe Principles we need onely reade the <hi>Memorials</hi> of <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, thoſe of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident <hi>Jannin,</hi> and of the Biſhop of <hi>Rodes;</hi> and conclude, that whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever that Potent King had conceived in his imagination, this King intends to bring forth by the power of his Armies. But as the deſire of Glory hath no bounds, and that his years and preſent condition put him in a capacitie to run a longer courſe then <hi>Henry</hi> the Great; ſo we cannot rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably expect that the ſwiftneſs of the <hi>Rhine</hi> ſhall be able to ſtop him.</p>
               <p>His Writers have taken a great deal of pains to nouriſh him in theſe thoughts: and as that ſort of men have no other ſtudie but to obſerve the weakneſs of their Prince, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to inſinuate their Flatteries, they have freely ſacrificed their mercenarie Pens to tickle this natural deſire of Glory which they have diſcovered in him. The Rewards they have receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed are authentick marks of his Acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptance; and this acknowledgment in
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:101549:16"/>a young ſpirit, that believeth himſelf to be in a poſture to execute all that pleaſeth him, and which hath drunk in this Maxime, That to take poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion by the Sword any Title is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, muſt needs be eſteemed a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous forerunning Sentence againſt all thoſe upon whom he ſhall believe that he hath any thing to pretend.</p>
               <p>Which yet more clearly to make appear to us, we onely need reade the printed Books which have lately been dedicated unto him, and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally one above the reſt, which carries the Title of <hi>THE J<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ST PRETENSIONS OF THE KING OF</hi> FRANCE <hi>TO THE EM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PIRE;</hi> where having laid down for a Ground, That the Dominions of Sovereign Princes have always been the Dominions and Conqueſts of their Eſtates, and, That the Dominions and Conqueſts of Crowns can neither be alienated nor preſcribed; he adds the two Articles following:
<list>
                     <item>1. That <hi>the greateſt part of</hi> Germanie <hi>is the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony and ancient Inheritance of</hi>
                        <pb n="10" facs="tcp:101549:17"/>French <hi>Princes:</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>2. Charlemagne <hi>did poſſeſs</hi> Germanie <hi>as King of</hi> France, <hi>and not as Emperour.</hi>
                     </item>
                  </list>
I leave to thoſe who will vouchſafe to reade over this Treatiſe, to form the Conſequences from ſuch Premiſſes.</p>
               <p>If one may judge of what is to come by what is paſt, all <hi>Europe</hi> will have cauſe enough to ſtand upon her guard, if it doth but reflect upon the conduct of <hi>France</hi> ſince the cloſe of the <hi>Pyrenean</hi> Peace till this minute. Hardly did we ſee that Treatie eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed upon the moſt religious and inviolable Laws that humane Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence could deviſe, when preſently, upon a ſmall punctilio of difference for the precedency of Embaſſadors, (which had been always in diſpute, and was left undecided by the Peace) they proceeded to the uttermoſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities againſt a Father-in-Law, at the ſame time when they ſuffered without murmuring the unheard-of Indignities which the Grand Vizier at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> cauſed to be committed againſt the Royal Perſon of the moſt
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:101549:17"/>Chriſtian King in that of his Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador; and when they did admit, without taking the leaſt offence thereat, the Competition for place betwixt the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Embaſſadors and theirs: which is ſo much the more remarkable, that even in the <hi>Pyrenean</hi> Treatie the two Crowns marched e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually hand in hand together; and that in one of the Inſtruments there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <hi>Spain</hi> was the firſt nominated, and in the other <hi>France.</hi> Why then did they conclude the Peace with this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualitie, if they were reſolved to break it afterwards upon the point of Competition? Which makes it evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently ſeen, that from the very day of the Peace they have always watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the occaſions of War, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded this Treatie onely to take a little breath to ſettle their Revenues at home, and make an end of redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing their people under the yoak.</p>
               <p>The Boneſires which were every where kindled for joy of the Peace were not quite extinguiſhed, when an evident breach of the Treatie was
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:101549:18"/>ſeen by the Succours which <hi>France</hi> ſent into <hi>Portugal;</hi> at the beginning under the name of the Marſhal of <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renne,</hi> and a little while after without any kind of diſguiſe. A Sedition which happened at <hi>Rome,</hi> to the great diſpleaſure of the Pope, by the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers who were provoked with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finity of Inſolencies committed by the <hi>French</hi> Embaſſador's Familie,<note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Creqny.</hi>
                  </note> was near putting all <hi>Italy</hi> again into Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſtion, had not the tears of his <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs</hi> ſtopt it, by ſacrificing his own Kindred, and erecting a Pyramide to <hi>France</hi> for an unworthy Trophie of the ſpoils of the glory of the Vicarie of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and the common Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, of whom they ſtyle themſelves the Eldeſt Sons.</p>
               <p>A little after they obliged the Duke <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>Lorrain</hi> to ſell them his Dutchy, to the prejudice of the lawful Succeſſor: and the Contract not being valid, they forced him with violence to put the onely place which was left him into their hands; by means whereof (revoking their Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain)
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:101549:18"/>they got the thing without pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the price.</p>
               <p>The Biſhop of <hi>Munſter,</hi> who was included in the League of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> ſeeing himſelf attaqued in the Empire by the States of <hi>Holland,</hi> in vain im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plored their aſſiſtance, by virtue of the Warrantie: but when he began to reſent it, he was ſtraight aſſaulted by the <hi>French</hi> Troups: and if his own Enemies had not ſhewn more mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration towards him then their Allies, his Countrey (which is of the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the Church) had been at preſent totally reduced into Aſhes.</p>
               <p>The War of <hi>England</hi> againſt the States of the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Provinces,</hi> which was raiſed by the <hi>French</hi> practices, and fomented by their induſtry, in giving the counterpoiſe to him who for the time appeared the weaker, hath ſufficiently inſtructed all the World, that the Game of <hi>France</hi> is to depreſs all Powers which are capable of obſtructing the torrent of their Enterprizes.</p>
               <p>But to ſtray no farther from the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:101549:19"/>matter which I have in hand, I will be contented to note onely two plain Arguments, which evidently prove that their Deſign is to drive on their Conqueſts as far as ever the fortune of War will ſuffer them, and that thoſe Overtures of Peace which they do make are but to amuſe the neighbouring Princes, and to bridle their own Subjects; believing that the firſt will not have recourſe to Arms for hindring their progreſs, ſo long as they have any hopes to get it done by Negotiation; and that the others, terrified with the apprehenſion of the quick end of this War, ſhall not dare to make uſe of any occaſion which they will hold to be uncertain and ſtaggering.</p>
               <p>The firſt Argument is, That at the inſtant when they profeſs to ſeek Peace, they have laid an eſſential Obſtacle in the way, by concluding a League offenſive with <hi>Portugal</hi> for ten years; by the which they binde themſelves not to treat, unleſs the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> may be intirely ſatisfied.
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:101549:19"/>They are not ignorant how exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant the demands of that People are, and that this is to touch <hi>Spain</hi> in the apple of the eye, and put the ſame ſtop to the Peace which was the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Difficultie in the Debates of the <hi>Pyrenean</hi> Treatie. The ſame League carries (as it is written from <hi>Lisbon</hi>) that all the Harbours which the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueſe</hi> ſhall take in <hi>Spain,</hi> either up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the one or the other Sea, ſhall be put into the power of <hi>France:</hi> which directly correſponds to the Deſign which they have of late framed, to make that Kingdom abſolute Miſtreſs<note n="*" place="margin">Of the Article <hi>England</hi> had need take care.</note> of the Trade. All this hath no connexion with their Claim to <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant</hi> and the other Provinces: and if they had no other Deſign then to take poſſeſſion of their pretended Goods, without breaking the Peace, they would not contrive the acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of Ports where they themſelves confeſs that they have nothing to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is, That at the ſame time when they proteſt they have no
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:101549:20"/>deſign to break the Peace, they la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to deſtroy the Foundations of it, and to take away all hopes of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation, by annulling the Queen's Renunciation, upon which the whole <hi>Pyrenean</hi> Treaty doth ſo lean, that in caſe this <hi>Baſis</hi> ſhall be overturned, of neceſſity the whole Fabrick muſt fall. If this Renunciation doth not ſubſiſt, there is no way left for an Accommodation, nor means of find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any ſecuritie neceſſary to it. The Peace which ſhall be made cannot be but the ſeed of a new War; it will be impoſſible to cut the evil by the root. 'Tis here where the Mediators ſhall find themſelves puzzled: and if all their Pretenſions be granted, then will they be abſolute Maſters of the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> and in a condition to take poſſeſſion by the ſame Title not onely of that part of <hi>Brabant</hi> of which the States of the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Provinces</hi> ſtand poſſeſſed, but alſo of all the reſt of their Countreys, as I ſhall make appear more at large in the Fifth Article. If they adjudge unto
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:101549:20"/>them that part which we hold, they give a previous Sentence againſt themſelves, and will be condemned by their own Decree. But if <hi>France</hi> content it ſelf with a part, it will be needful that the Queen ſhould paſs a new Act of Renunciation touching all the remainder, which, according to their Principles, muſt be ſubject to the ſame cauſes of Nullity that the firſt is; if it be true that Princes can never lawfully renounce their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Rights: And I do not ſee how they can finde new Clauſes nor new Oaths to make this Act more ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>revocable then that which they ſeek to deſtroy. However, though all they ask at preſent were granted them, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could be ſolidly treated of, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe by annulling the Renunciation we ſhould open a door unto them to bring in a new Pretenſion upon all the Monarchie; and then muſt the Peace needs be as brittle as is the life of a young Infant, who hath yet a thouſand dangers to go through be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he can reach to thoſe years in
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:101549:21"/>which he ſhall be able to ſecure the Succeſſion in his own Line, and cut off the courſe of the vaſt hopes of thoſe who build the deſign of an <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal Dominion</hi> upon his Death. In a word, it is ſuperfluous to reaſon by Arguments, when the things do ſpeak of themſelvs. The moſt Chriſtian King had the goodneſs to undeceive us in the vain hopes of a Peace, by a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter written by his order to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs <hi>de la Fuente,</hi> upon the Offer made by his Excellency the Marqueſs of <hi>Caſtel-Rodrigo</hi> in moſt reſpectful terms, to enter into a Treatie of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation, and remit the buſineſs to the Arbitration of the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Princes; by his Anſwer he doth not onely reject the Propoſition, and look upon it as an injury, but be frames to himſelf a voluntary impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibilitie of a Peace, which he eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſheth upon the Reply of our Queen to the Marqueſs <hi>de la Fuente,</hi> in proſecution of a Diſcourſe which the Queen of <hi>France</hi> had ſlightly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated to the ſaid Marqueſs by way
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:101549:21"/>of Converſation, and ſtrives to ſettle upon ſo weak a ground-work not onely the Juſtice of his Arms, but alſo an eſſential Obſtacle to a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation.</p>
               <p>By all theſe palpable Verities, which cannot be called in queſtion, it is eaſie to diſcern, That <hi>France,</hi> imploying her endeavour to render the Peace impoſſible or unſure, aims abſolutely at the intire Deſtruction of a Monarchy which is the Bulwark of all the reſt, that ſhe may attaque them with leſs trouble, having thus beaten down their Flankers. It is left to wiſe Politicians to make neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary reflexions upon a matter of ſuch high concernment.</p>

               <p>I deſire very much that he would
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:101549:22"/>explain unto us what he means by the word <hi>Rupture,</hi> and how he can recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile a violent Intruſion by the power of men and Cannons with the due obſervation of a Treatie, which in the firſt place doth prohibit all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſuch armed attempts, and which is inſtituted to no other end but to hinder them. I would know how he can make the Peace ſubſiſt with the moſt lamentable effects of War; and how that by the onely defect of the formalitie of ſending a Herauld at Arms to denounce it, it loſes all its bitterneſs and injuſtice. For my own part, (who uſe to reaſon more dully) I have always held that to be a Rup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which is inconſiſtent with the eſſence of Peace, which overthrows the foundations and troubles all the harmony of it. There are certain Attempts which may alter a Peace, and yet not break it, which be rather Contraventions then Infringings, and which do not give the parties injured the right of Revenging themſelves by Arms, but onely to pretend Repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:101549:23"/>by more gentle means. The <hi>Turks</hi> do not eſteem to be a Rupture the Incurſions which are made by the one or the other partie in times of Peace, provided they be not accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with Infantry and Cannon. But when one doth act by open force with the full bodies of an Army, followed with all the Train neceſſary for great Enterprizes; that Subjects are ſolicited to rebell againſt their Prince, and that they are compelled under the penalty of the Confiſcation of their Goods to take an unjuſt Oath, without proceſſe and without forme of Law; I do avow that I am ignorant what either Peace, War, Treaties, or Ruptures are, if all theſe things can have any compatibilitie together at the ſame time. It is a new knowledge in Law whereof the Ancients were ignorant, who have left us an Inſtruction totally oppoſite to this doctrine:<note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>But that we may be the more able to judge in this buſineſs, it is neceſſary that we examine all the terms of the Treatie of Peace, and conſider the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the effects and the ends of the ſame; to conclude that if all thoſe be deſtroyed by this Invaſion, it cannot be called by any other name then by that of a manifeſt Rupture.</p>
               <p>The motive Cauſe of the Peace was, <hi>The deſire of the good, quiet and eaſe of their good Subjects:</hi> The Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject was, <hi>To put a period to ſo many miſchiefs:</hi> The Effect, <hi>To forget and extinguiſh all the cauſes and motives of the Warrs paſt, and to eſtabliſh a ſincere, entire, and durable Peace betwixt them and their Succeſſors.</hi> All theſe are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrown by this preſent Attempt, which doth trouble the good and tranquillity of the people, renew the publick misfortunes, rekindle and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuſcitate all the cauſes and motives of the Warrs paſt, and raiſe new ones. I do not ſee how one can conceive
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:101549:24"/>that Peace ſhould ſubſiſt with an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion, which ruines it in its Cauſe, in its Ends, and in all its Effects.</p>
               <p>Moreover, if the Entry of the moſt Chriſtian King into theſe Provinces be but a ſimple taking of poſſeſſion, yet is it altogether illegal, contrary to the Laws of Nations, and to the cuſtomes and practice of the Civil and Municipal Laws, as I will make appear in the Article following; and what colour ſoever theſe do put upon it, it cannot paſs but for the way of Fact, which is never permitted ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept by the Law of War. So that by endeavouring to take away the name of <hi>War</hi> from this Invaſion, they do deprive it of that Veil which was able to cover it at leaſt with the falſe appearance of the Right of Arms, and manifeſtly conclude, that if it be not a Rupture, 'tis a violent Intruſion; if it be not a War, 'tis a Depredation and Piracie; and if it be not an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringing of the Peace, it is an unjuſt Attempt, which gives a ſhock to all Laws and Forms. Thus are the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:101549:24"/>
                  <hi>French</hi> intangled in their own Nets, and thinking to make their Cauſe plauſible, or leſs odious, by a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiltie which hath neither body nor ſubſtance, they deſtroy the principal Foundation of it, and take from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the means of eſtabliſhing their Conqueſt upon the right of War, by declaring that they will Conquer without breaking the Peace.<note place="margin">L.

               </p>
               <p>We do ordinarily diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Contravention, Infringing, and Rupture. The firſt is but an Abuſe either in action or omiſſion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to ſome particular Condition, which hinders not the exiſtence of a Treatie in its integritie, and onely af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords the parties concerned a right to pretend that the Dammage be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired. The ſecond ſhocks the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Peace, overthrows the Ground-work of it, and gives a right to purſue ſatisfaction by Arms, if it cannot be obtained by any other
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:101549:25"/>way. The third conſiſts ſimply in thoſe acts of Hoſtilitie which are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compatible with Peace, which is in one word when one purſues his Right by force: And War, according to the opinion of Civilians, is nothing elſe but <hi>A Contention by ſtrength of hands and by violence of Arms.</hi> O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers take the word Rupture more at large, and extend it to three caſes: The firſt, to every Act which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the nature and ends of Peace: the ſecond, to the committing or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting of ſomething which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the expreſs tenour of the Treatie: the third, to the making of ſome Attempt which brings Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences along with it incompatible with all that can be underſtood by the name of Peace. <hi>Grotius lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 20. Theſe three Conditions meet here: there is open Force; there is an expreſs Contravention to the moſt eſſential Articles; and Conſequences which induce an irreparable Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage.</p>
               <p>The Contravention to the Treatie
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:101549:25"/>on the part of <hi>France</hi> may evidently be proved by a multitude of Acts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to the ſinceritie of that Friendſhip which the two Kings pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed each other, which is the chief End of this Peace, and which over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throws the Conditions agreed on be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them. The ſecret practices, both within and without the Realm, have never ceaſed ſince the Peace; thus to keep the Monarchy at a check, and to raiſe enemies and enviers to it from all parts. The <hi>Portugueſes</hi> have almoſt totally ſubſiſted ever ſince up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the proviſion of Corn which hath been ſent them out of <hi>France;</hi> and in all the Debates which have happened either touching the Execution or the Interpretation of the Treatie, or the Purchaſe of <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> they have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies alledged unto us their Will in place of all other Reaſon, offering to give us the Law even in our own houſes, and to forbid the reparation even of our own Chanells; ſo that upon the leaſt difference wherein we did not yield unto them without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:101549:26"/>whatever they asked, they have preſently returned the bargain in our hand. If any Leagues were propoſed for our Defence onely, inſtantly they thundred out againſt us menaces of War; which was a word ſo frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the mouth of the Archbiſhop of <hi>Ambrun,</hi> that upon buſineſs of no va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, and between private perſons, he inſtantly made a publick concernment. In fine, they have made uſe with ſo much exorbitancie of the ſtrong In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination which they obſerved in us for the preſervation of Peace, that they have ſtill imployed, upon the ſlighteſt occaſions, the Scare-crow of War, thinking thereby to pull from us all that their humour made them deſire.</p>
               <p>Though our condition were very unfortunate to live in this continual Diſquiet, to ſee the Sword alwaies hanging over our heads, and our Repoſe tied to ſo ſmall a thread: yet the remembrance of our former Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, and the apprehenſion of what might come hereafter, made us pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:101549:26"/>an uncertain and tottering Reſt before thoſe inevitable Confuſions and Troubles which a Rupture would produce; and expect that our Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration might touch their hearts, or that the Divine Providence would by ſome other means provide for our ſafety. But this Patience of ours hath ſerved them for a Ladder where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they have mounted to open In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringings of the Peace, which cannot admit of any Interpretation or Exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation: And I defie all the ſubtiltie of the <hi>Gallicane</hi> litigious Cavills, to palliate them with the leaſt pretext or meaneſt appearance of Juſtice. 'Tis here that I do intreat the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to ſhew me no favour, but to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt himſelf of all kind of Compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie which perhaps he may have for us, to retain all his Partialitie (if any he have) for our Enemies, and to judge of our Cauſe with the uttermoſt of Rigour.</p>
               <p>The Abandoning of <hi>Portugal</hi> is one of the eſſential Foundations of the Peace; without that it could never
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:101549:27"/>have been treated of nor concluded: <hi>France</hi> doth declare it by theſe words, in the LX Article of the ſaid Treatie: <hi>For aſ much as we have foreſeen and apprehended that ſuch an Engagement might be an Obſtacle not to be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted in the concluſion of the Peace, and conſequently reduce the Two Kings to a neceſſity of perpetuating the War.</hi> And a little beneath in the very ſame Article it goes on in theſe terms: <hi>In fine, in contemplation of the Peace, and ſeeing the abſolute neceſſity where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his moſt Chriſtian Majeſtie finds himſelf, either to perpetuate the War by a Rupture of the preſent Treatie, which he perceives to be inevitable, in caſe he ſhould have perſiſted to obtain in this Affair from his Catholick Majeſtie other Conditions then thoſe which he had offered,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>'Tis clear in the ſecond place by the ſame Article, that to oblige <hi>France</hi> to this Abandoning, the King of <hi>Spain</hi> refuſed from the moſt Chriſtian King the Reſtitution of all thoſe places and Dominions upon which the Arms of
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:101549:27"/>
                  <hi>France</hi> had ſeiſed during the War. The terms are clear in the ſame Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle: <hi>Offering, beſides the places which are to be reſtored unto his Catholick Majeſtie by the preſent Treatie, to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der unto him alſo all the other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts in general which his ſaid Arms have made in this War, and intirely to reſtore the Prince of</hi> Conde; <hi>providing, and upon condition, that the Affairs of the Kingdome of</hi> Portugal <hi>ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in the ſtate in which at preſent they are.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis likewiſe out of controverſie (every way) that this Abandoning of <hi>Portugal</hi> was covenanted and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed by <hi>France,</hi> ſo authentically and in ſuch clear and ſpecial terms, that it cannot be called in queſtion, nor be made ſubject to any Interpretations contrary to the true ſenſe and intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Parties contracting. Here you have the terms: <hi>His ſaid Majeſtie ſhall meddle no more with the ſaid Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair, and doth promiſe and oblige himſelf upon his Honour, and in the Faith and the Word of a King, for himſelf and
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:101549:28"/>his Succeſſors, not to give unto the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Kingdom of</hi> Portugal, <hi>nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in general, nor to any perſon or perſons of it in particular, of what dignity, eſtate or condition they way be, neither for the preſent nor hereafter, any Aid or Aſſiſtance, publick or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, directly or indirectly, of Men, Arms, Ammunition, Victuals, Ships or Moneys, under any pretext, nor of any other thing that is or can be, by land nor by Sea, nor in any other far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion: as likewiſe not to permit that any Leavies ſhall be made in any of his moſt Chriſtian Majeſtie's Kingdoms and Eſtates, nor grant free paſſage to thoſe which may come out of other Countries to the help of the aforeſaid Realm of</hi> Portugal.</p>
               <p>'Tis no leſs evident that they have failed in every point and every cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance of this Promiſe; That from the very beginning they ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conveyed Troups into <hi>Portugal</hi> in ſeveral bodies; That at the ſelf-ſame time when, upon the complaints of the Marqueſs <hi>de la Fuente,</hi> they ſent
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:101549:28"/>publick Orders to the Governours of their Ports, that no Souldiers ſhould be ſuffered to imbark for <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal,</hi> they did not abſtain from making them paſs under-hand and by conni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vence; That a little while after the Marſhall of <hi>Turenne</hi> publickly made Leavies for their aſſiſtance; and that the Marqueſs <hi>de la Fuente</hi> having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented that this was a direct Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travention to the Treatie of Peace, they pay'd him with this cold and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainfull Anſwer, that it was a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular act of the Marſhall of <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renne</hi>'s, in which the Court of <hi>France</hi> had no hand; That they continued to provide them with Corn and all other ſorts of Ammunition for War: And all this whilſt the effect of the pretended <hi>Devolution</hi> was yet uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and could no waies operate even among private perſons, unleſs the Daughter did ſurvive the Father, and before ever the <hi>French</hi> made any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance or Overture touching that Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion.</p>
               <p>We have in our hands the Letters
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:101549:29"/>intercepted, which make faith that the Court of <hi>France</hi> hath ever ſince the Peace fomented the Obſtinacie of the <hi>Portugueſes,</hi> that ſhe hath hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred them from accepting the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious Conditions which were offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them, animating them by a hope of mightie Succours not onely for their own Defence, but alſo for car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying an Offenſive War into the very heart of <hi>Spain:</hi> We have many Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Monſieur <hi>de Lionne</hi> and the Archbiſhop of <hi>Ambrun</hi> to Monſieur <hi>de Shomberg,</hi> which prove the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Correſpondence which was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them, for the direction of that War. No body is ignorant how the Duke of <hi>Beaufort</hi> the laſt year came with his whole Fleet upon the Coaſts of <hi>Portugal,</hi> where he ſpent a part of the Summer, to the great prejudice of his Allies, onely to ſecure the paſſage of Victuals and Ammunition, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> were in extreme want; and that at the ſame time when they were offering us their Mediati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to work an Accommodation with
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:101549:29"/>
                  <hi>Portugal.</hi> All the World knows that Monſieur <hi>Colbert</hi> privately made ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral voiages thither, to encourage them, and contract a ſecret Alliance with them: That the Sieur <hi>Courtin,</hi> a little while after the cloſe of the <hi>Pyrenean</hi> Treatie, went expreſsly into <hi>England,</hi> to move the King of Great <hi>Britain</hi> not to abandon the <hi>Portugue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</hi> We intercepted in a <hi>French</hi> Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, which came from <hi>Portugal,</hi> the accompt of the Expences and the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours which <hi>France</hi> hath given with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out intermiſſion to that Kingdome ſince the Concluſion of the Peace; whereby it is clear, amongſt other things, that the <hi>French</hi> have alwaies entertained Troups at their own charge to uphold this War.</p>
               <p>And for the Maſter-piece of all theſe unjuſt proceedings, <hi>France</hi> it ſelf can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deny, but that it hath lately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded a League offenſive with that Kingdome againſt all its Enemies. The principal Conditions of this League are: <hi>That they ſhall be the Friends of their Friends, and the Enemies of their
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:101549:30"/>Enemies, excepting</hi> England: <hi>That</hi> France <hi>ſhall furniſh them with as many men as they need, to carry on an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive War in</hi> Spain <hi>both by Sea and land; ſhall advance unto them by way of loan the half of their Pay; for the entertainment of Auxiliarie Troups; and that they ſhall furniſh them every year, under the ſame title of Loan, with the ſum of three hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Crowns: That all the Ports which they ſhall take in</hi> Spain, <hi>either upon the one or the other Sea, ſhall be put into the power of</hi> France: <hi>That they ſhall not treat, neither of Peace nor Truce, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out common conſent: That this League ſhall laſt for the ſpace of ten years.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By the clauſes above ſpecified of the <hi>Pyrenean</hi> Treatie it may be ſeen, that the Abandoning of <hi>Portugal</hi> was both an eſſential and fundamental point of the Peace: That his Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Majeſtie preferred that Intereſt before all the Provinces, Eſtates, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions and ſtrong Holds which he quitted to <hi>France,</hi> and which he might have recovered, if he would have
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:101549:30"/>yielded in the Affair of <hi>Portugal.</hi> So that <hi>France</hi> doth not juſtly poſſeſs ſo many places as have been made over to her, but in ſo farre as ſhe hath ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied the Condition in contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whereof they were given, and without which all would have been reſtored to us.</p>
               <p>Whereby it is proved, that the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick and ſecret Aids which <hi>France</hi> hath given to that Kingdome, and particularly the League offenſive which ſhe hath concluded with it, are not ſimple Contraventions or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringements, but an open Rupture of the Treatie of Peace, which reſtores his Catholick Majeſtie to the juſt right of pretending to and redemanding of whatever hath been accorded to <hi>France</hi> by virtue of this ſame Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and all the Expence &amp; Dammages which the continuation of this War, and the impediments which <hi>France</hi> hath brought to an Accommodation, have occaſioned to the Crown of <hi>Spain.</hi> This Concluſion is founded upon three invincible Reaſons.</p>

               <p>The firſt is drawn from the Third Article of the Inſtrument of Peace, whereby it is agreed, That, <hi>to avoid the Differences which may afterwards happen between ſome Princes or Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates, Allies of the ſaid Kings,</hi> &amp;c. if they cannot reconcile them by their Interpoſition, and that the ſaid Allies ſhall therefore take Arms, <hi>every one of the ſaid Kings may help his own Allie with his forces, without coming to any Rupture betwixt their Majeſties by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of ſuch Aſſiſtance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But in the end of the ſame Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle <hi>Portugal</hi> is expreſsly excepted. From whence may be deduced this evident Conſequence, That if the Treatie doth allow the two Kings to aſſiſt their Allies, without break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Peace, <hi>Portugal</hi> excepted; it muſt follow that <hi>France</hi> cannot aſſiſt <hi>Portugal</hi> without Rupture, ſince that Kingdome is excepted by a clauſe reſtrictve of the general proviſion which is made for all the other Allies.</p>
               <p>And in the cloſe of the ſame Third Article all manner of Succours is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:101549:31"/>prohibited to be given <hi>to the Subjects which might hereafter revolt againſt either of the ſaid Kings,</hi> to limit the permiſſion contained in the ſaid Article of aſſiſting the Allies without Rupture, onely to Lawfull Princes and Potentates, with an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute excluſion of all Rebells.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is, That the Treatie is trulie broken, when by an Attempt of one of the Parties it is reduced to ſuch terms in which it could never have been concluded nor commenced: <hi>Lege quod ab initio, F. de Reg. Jur.</hi> It is certain by the LX. Article above cited, and by the proper Declaration of <hi>France,</hi> That <hi>this Engagement with</hi> Portugal <hi>was an inſuperable Obſtacle to the Concluſion of Peace.</hi> It is then clearer then the day, that ſince the Peace could never have been made without the Abandoning of <hi>Portugal,</hi> it cannot ſubſiſt with thoſe Succours nor with that League.</p>
               <p>The third Reaſon is, That by the League offenſive with <hi>Portugal</hi> they do declare themſelves Enemies to the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:101549:32"/>Enemies the one of the other, <hi>England</hi> onely excepted. It follows then ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly, that the Crown of <hi>Spain</hi> not being excepted, but on the contrarie this League being directly againſt it, his moſt Chriſtian Majeſtie hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared himſelf an open Enemie to <hi>Spain,</hi> by concluding it with this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
               <p>Let us add to all this the Hoſtilitie already begun againſt thoſe of <hi>Armen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers,</hi> the Detention of the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of that place, the Maſſacre o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <argument>
                  <p>That this Rupture is unjuſt. ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting that the Rights of the moſt Chriſtian King were well founded.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THE Injuſtice of the Rupture, and the infringing of the Peace by the Succours which <hi>France</hi> hath ſent into the Kingdom of <hi>Portugal,</hi> and by the League newly concluded with them, is ſo manifeſt of it ſelf and ſo clearly proved, that it were to have an ill opinion of the ſufficiency and the Judgment of the Readers, and to abuſe their leiſure, to employ time or Reaſons to render it more evident.</p>
               <p>But to give our Enemies yet a lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Carreer, and fight with them with leſs advantage; I am content for once to tie my hands, and ſhut my eyes to all our Rights, and grant them by a falſe ſuppoſition (which I reſerve to be deſtroyed in the following Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles)
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:101549:33"/>that their Pretenſions are Juſt, and grounded on ſolid Foundations. I will alſo for this time afford them the libertie of deciding this Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on either by publick Right or Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicipal Cuſtomes: Though in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quel I will make them ſee, that 'tis ſolely the Treatie of Peace which ought to be the Judge of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs. And after I have granted them (of my own accord, and without preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice) all thoſe advantages which may ſeem to give them the gain of the Cauſe, my onely aim in this Article is, to demonſtrate That this Invaſion and Rupture is unjuſt, contrarie to the Laws of Nations, and void of all thoſe forms which are neceſſarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to make a War lawfull; That the Oath which <hi>France</hi> doth exact from the People without diſcuſſing the Cauſe is unjuſt, inconſiſtent with the Divine Laws, with the obligation of their Conſciences, and drawing after it moſt pernicious Conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces againſt all Princes, to render the Fidelity of their Subjects expoſed to
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:101549:34"/>all Winds; and in concluſion, That the care which they take for their Defence is a preciſe and undiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable Duty, and cannot without Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnie be termed by the name either of <hi>Rebellion</hi> or <hi>Rupture.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If we conſider this buſineſs accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to publick Right and the Law of Nations, all States-men and Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers will agree, that to a juſt War the ſubſequent conditions are neceſſarie; Sovereign Authority, a juſt Title, a preceding Requiſition of that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction which is pretended, joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to an obſtinate and invincible Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal by the contrarie partie, in ſuch ſort that the Dammage cannot be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwaies repaired but by Arms, and finally a legal Denunciation of War formally intimated by a ſolemn De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree to the Partie.</p>
               <p>Here it might be ſaid, that the moſt Chriſtian King doth not act in this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion in the quality of a Sovereign, and ought not to be conſidered but as a particular Pretender in matter of Succeſſion, in regard he grounds all
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:101549:34"/>his Right upon the Provincial Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes eſtabliſhed between private perſons by their own conſents, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out interpoſition of the supreme Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority ſo much as by a Decree of ſimple Approbation, and which by conſequence cannot give him any right to make War. But I reſerve this matter to be treated of more ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie in another place.</p>
               <p>The juſt Title is wanting. Though we ſhould ſuppoſe that his Right were well grounded, (which notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding is controverted) the contrarie partie is in peaceable Poſſeſſion, foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon the common Right of sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign succeſſions, upon a Treatie of Peace, upon an authentick Renunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, upon a Teſtament, and upon a continual Cuſtome. In doubtfull caſes the favour of the Laws is for the Poſſeſſor: It is the part of the Actor to prove and verfie his Right. The Judges themſelves cannot pronounce ſentence without duely hearing of the parties: <hi>Qui ſtatuit aliquid parte in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>auditâ alterâ,</hi> &amp;c. It is much more
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:101549:35"/>unjuſt that the parties ſhould doe Juſtice to themſelves without form of Proceſs. If it were permitted to Kings and Potentates to right them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves inſtantly, and to ſeiſe by force of Arms whatſoever they believe they may have cauſe to pretend to, there would be no Poſſeſſion ſecure in this world. If it be ſufficient to have made a Book be compoſed by an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate to juſtifie a Right, and to be able thereafter to proſecute it by force; if no Treaties nor Renuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions nor Preſcriptions are able to ſtop the current of it; there is no more ſecurity in the world for <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Germanie, Holland, Lorrain, Italie, Corſica,</hi> and <hi>Caſtile:</hi> all the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations are already framed for their Ruine, the Books are already com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, the Cauſe is judged in the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal of <hi>France,</hi> the right of War is eſtabliſhed, the Arms are ready, there wants nothing but an Occaſion to take poſſeſſion of their Eſtates by a Right proved by the ſame forms, and adjudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the ſame Authority which hath
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:101549:35"/>determined their Pretenſions againſt us. <hi>Caſſan, Aubery, Arroyus, Peter du Puy,</hi> and the nameleſs Author of the Treatie of the Intereſts and Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imes of Princes, with an infinitie of other turbulent ſpirits wherewith <hi>France</hi> doth abound, are as competent Arbiters in this point, as the Writer who forged the Rights of the Queen. <hi>France,</hi> by the ſame moderation which it uſes towards us, void of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition to extend its Limits, of the deſire of Glorie, of the intention of Rupture, but onely for publick good, <hi>&amp; Officii Religione impulſa,</hi> may drive them out of their Poſſeſſions, to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh her own, and yet they ſhould not be able with reaſon to complain of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Injuſtice, if they ſhould ſuffer them freely to introduce this dangerous Prejudication.

All War that is not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary is againſt the Law of God and Nature, as the ſame S. <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> doth explicate it in the ſame place, and is not permitted but as the laſt means, when all others are found to be ineffectual. <hi>Extrema primo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo tentavit loco.</hi> To judge from theſe grounds of the Juſtice of this War, we muſt examine by parcells the procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding which <hi>France</hi> hath held in ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Satisfaction, and it will clearly be ſeen, that ſhe hath carefully ſhunned the true means of obtaining it by lawfull courſes; that ſhe hath provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked us with divers Injuries, as I ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before; that not onely her firſt end and ſole deſign hath been to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new the War, but alſo to ſurprize us by a falſe pretext of Peace and Friendſhip.</p>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:101549:37"/>
               <p>The Conduct which Decency and the Law of Nations ſeemed to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe to them in this occaſion was, to advertiſe the Queen preſently, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the death of the late King, by an authentick and legal way, (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Cuſtome amongſt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs) as by ſome Envoy, or by their ordinary Embaſſador at the Court of <hi>Spain,</hi> to acquaint her with the ſubject of their Pretenſions, and to ſhew<note n="*" place="margin">The QUEEN-Regent of <hi>Spain.</hi>
                  </note> her the reaſons and inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of them, to require Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, or elſe to propoſe ways of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement: in caſe of refuſal, to declare ſolemnly, that they ſhould be forced to take Arms, if they could obtain nothing by Reaſon and fair means. After all this it became them, according to all manner of Law, to have had recourſe to the immediate Lord of thoſe Fiefs to which they pretended, either for ſubmitting themſelves to his Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration, or at leaſt for ſeeking his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſition, and laying open their Rights before him.</p>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:101549:37"/>
               <p>But far from all this they began with Leagues, with Aids ſent to the <hi>Portugueſes,</hi> with ſecret Practices a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt our People, and a thouſand unworthy Intrigues, forerunners and evident diſcoveries of a formed De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of War; and in place of all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timation or ſeeking after amicable ways, they have contented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with a ſimple familiar Diſcourſe which paſſed in Converſation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Queen of <hi>France</hi> and the Marqueſs <hi>de la Fuente.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here it is wherein evidently doth appear a proceeding full of Artifice, which cannot tend but to two ends; the one, to have in time and place a fitting occaſion to bring War upon us, and in ſome kinde to juſtifie by that Demand the Violence which they did reſolve to found upon our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal; the other, That they might be able to ſurpriſe us, and make us neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the care of our Defence and Safetie, and might avoid thoſe Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacles which by the good offices of the neighbouring Princes, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſed
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:101549:38"/>in the Cauſe, they foreſaw would certainly have been employed from all parts to prevent a War, from which they would not be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted by any manner of Agreement. They feared that if they had obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved all the Formalities which I have above related, they ſhould have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us an Alarm out of ſeaſon, and have awakened us out of that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Sleep into which our confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in their Treaties and words had lulled us: They judged reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably enough, that all the neighbour-States would ſufficiently apprehend the Conſequences of this War, to make uſe or all their care and power to terminate this Difference by an Accommodation: They ſaw that an expreſs Declaration of their Deſign might open the eyes of all the World; and that, on the other part, a ſudden Invaſion without any preceding For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malitie would bring an univerſal blame upon them, and convict them of manifeſt Injuſtice: They have choſen this weak middle betwixt
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:101549:38"/>thoſe two extremes, to throw in the aire an empty Propoſition without matter and without form, to the end they might take the advantage of our Anſwer when their buſineſs ſhould ſuffer it; knowing very well, that upon ſuch a weak ground we were not able to make any Reply to their full ſatisfaction: They be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved that by this cunning they ſhould have wherewithal to convince us without giving us the Alarm, and wherewith to prove their Moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on without being obliged to deſiſt from their Violences. But God is not ſo cheated, nor men of ſound un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding: theſe are Spiders webs, which are good for nothing but to catch flies. Yet of thoſe things do they make the Frontiſpice of their work and the Foundation of their Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: they do move and beſtir them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon them with that life which is ſo natural unto them, imagining that having this Shield, we ſhall not carry in a ſtroak upon them which they ſhall not be able to ward.</p>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:101549:39"/>
               <p>To judge well of the matter, we muſt enter upon the truth of the Fact, which the Author of theſe Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bells falſifies in all its circumſtances. The very firſt words of his Preface contain a palpable Untruth; which is, <hi>A little after the deceaſed Queen-Mother had paid to the Memorie of the Catholick King, her Brother, all the Duties and all the Civilities which are uſual in ſuch occaſions, ſhe ſent to call the Marqueſs</hi> de la Fuente, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is certain by the Relation of the Marqueſs <hi>de la Fuente,</hi> and by the date of his Letters written to <hi>Spain,</hi> that the Queen-Mother held this diſcourſe with him on the 13. of <hi>Auguſt;</hi> and all the world knows that the King died not till the 17. of the Month following.</p>
               <p>'Tis a thing of bad preſage to the ſucceſs of this Writing, that the firſt words of the Preface ſhould begin with ſo notable a Lie, which gives juſt cauſe to believe that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of the ſame Work, which promiſes to our people <hi>a Haven of
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:101549:39"/>Benedictions,</hi> if they will come under their power, ſhall be of the ſame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and that the Epilogue will cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpond to the <hi>Exordium,</hi> by the juſt Conformitie which ſuch a great O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratour, without doubt, ought to have obſerved in all the parts of a Piece which he began to meditate from the very day of the Peace; ſince in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect he is not aſhamed to avow, that they did not conſent to the Act of Renunciation but with a formed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to break it.</p>
               <p>Thus all that he doth alledgin conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of that Commiſſion which the Queen-Mother gave to the Marqueſs <hi>de la Fuente</hi> to write to the Queen of <hi>Spain</hi> on this ſubject, is but a weav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſame Untruth, ſince no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy can be ignorant that the Queen had no hand in Buſineſs whilſt the King lived, and that ſhe would by no means have intruded in a matter whereof ſhe had no manner of knowledge, and which was not then within the extent of her Sphere.</p>
               <p>That he may not give himſelf the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:101549:40"/>lie, he continues ſtill to accumulate Lies upon Lies. The Diſcourſe which the Queen-Mother held with the Marqueſs was altogether of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other ſtrain then that which he ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth. This wiſe Princeſs, who conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the Peace as her own work, and who knew the unquietneſs of the <hi>French</hi> humor, and the deſire of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry which boiled in the heart of her Son, thought fit to declare confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently her thoughts of it to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs <hi>de la Fuente,</hi> that they might ſearch joyntly for ſome means to ſtay his Impetuoſitie. She ingenuouſly repreſented unto him the trouble which the bad Suggeſtions which were infuſed into her Son upon vain pretenſions did occaſion to her, and ſhe intreated him to advertiſe the King her Brother thereof, that he might make ſuch Reflections thereon as were neceſſary; that ſhe would wiſh, that after he had given ſo much for the Peace, he would yet yield in ſomething to preſerve it, and ſtop the mouths of all ſuch as carried on
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:101549:40"/>the King her Son to violent Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions; that for her part ſhe would inculcate all the Moderation that ſhe did wiſh in him. Thus did that Royal and prudent Princeſs ſpeak, and wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed ſufficiently by her diſcourſe that ſhe had in horrour a Pretenſion which ſhe did not ſuſtain but by the fear of a greater evil. The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs <hi>de la Fuente</hi> did never charge himſelf with this Commiſſion, (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to what this Author doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late with the ſame fidelitie that he hath done all the reſt) for it is clear by the Relation which he ſent into <hi>spain</hi> upon this ſubject; and all thoſe who are but a very little verſed in the management of publick affairs will judge that he could not doe it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out he had been ignorant of the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of an Embaſſadour; (which cannot be preſumed of a Minister of ſo long experience, and who deſerves the general applauſe by his good beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour in ſo many great Embaſſages.) He knew too well that, being the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick King's Miniſter, he might not
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:101549:41"/>act as solicitor for the moſt Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an King; that he could not enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Negotiation upon a matter of this importance without an expreſs Order; that the ſole end of his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſage was, to cauſe the Treatie of Peace to be obſerved in every point, and not to overthrow the Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of it; and that the very diſcourſe of the Queen was not ſufficiently au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized, to frame an authentick Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to his Maſter, or to open a Negotiation. He ſatisfied himſelf then by remonſtrating to the Queen-Mother, in the freedome of the ſame familiar diſcourſe, the Reaſons which ought to divert the moſt Chriſtian King from ſuch thoughts, and did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech her to employ her endeavours to infuſe into him juſter &amp; more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate ones. Notwithſtanding, as Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors are bound to give their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters an account even of the ſmalleſt circumſtances of things, he could not omit to inform the Court of <hi>Spain</hi> of all this little Intrigue by way of Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and not by way of Propoſition,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:101549:41"/>and to intreat them to inſtruct him how he ſhould behave himſelf, in caſe that they ſhould make more le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall Inſtances unto him upon this ſubject. The King was yet alive when this Letter came; but falling ſick at the ſame time of the diſeaſe whereof he died, the Confuſion Wherein things were then afforded not leiſure to make much reflexion upon a Narration which had nothing of authentick in it: and they were content onely to give him order, that if the Queen-Mother ſhould again de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate upon that buſineſs, he ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form her fully touching the Rights of his Majeſtie, and let her know, that the Queen being neither Arbitreſs nor Miſtreſs of thoſe Affairs, ſhe could not of her ſelf diſpoſe of them du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring her Regencie.</p>
               <p>To this Anſwer no new Inſtance was made, no Propoſition, no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint. Monſieur <hi>de Bellefond</hi> was ſent to <hi>Madrid</hi> to complement the Queen, without making the leaſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verture unto her touching this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion.
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:101549:42"/>His moſt Chriſtian Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie hath not ceaſed ever ſince that time to confirm unto the Marqueſs <hi>de la Fuente</hi> the aſſurances of a firm reſolution to continue the Peace, without ever ſo much as once na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to him the name of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Devolution. The Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Ambrun</hi> (as I have already ſaid) hath ever ſince that time acted the part of a buſie man, by propoſing of Leagues and Mediations, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to make thoſe be looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as turbulent and ſeditious ſpirits who would have framed the leaſt ſcruple againſt the aſſurances which he gave. And in theſe laſt months paſſed the Marqueſs <hi>de la Fuente</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king leave of the King to return in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Spain,</hi> he poſitively charged him to engage his Faith and Word to the Queen, that he would keep with her and her Kingdoms a conſtant Amitie. Which Promiſe was not reſtricted by any Condition; it was full, free, and univerſal, without any inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixture of Complaints or Pretenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:101549:42"/>which might have given occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to ſecond thoughts.</p>
               <p>After all theſe things the Court of <hi>Spain</hi> had juſt cauſe to believe that the apprehenſions of the Queen-Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were but panick fears; that an exceſs of her love of Peace gave her vain ſuſpicions of things more remote; or that her Tears, her Reaſons, and the Supplications which ſhe tendered to the King her son when ſhe gave him her laſt Embraces, had mollified his heart; or that the prudent An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer of our Queen had convinced him; or, at the worſt, that he would have the patience to ſtay till our young Monarch were in a condition to underſtand and diſpoſe of his Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, that they might agree as Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers-in-Law, Kindred, and Friends, upon a Difference which could not ſo eaſily nor ſo ſecurely be ended du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his Minoritie.</p>
               <p>From this ſincere and true Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion all men who are not prepoſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed may eaſily judge, that the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe which the Queen held with
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:101549:43"/>the Marqueſs <hi>de la Fuente</hi> cannot be taken for a Denunciation, nor ſo much as for a Propoſition, or a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, or a ſimple Overture of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiation. The reaſons whereof are beyond replie.
<list>
                     <item>Firſt, Becauſe ſhe did it not in the name of the King, and did not avow ſo much as that he had any knowledge thereof; and that ſhe had no more any hand in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencie, nor in the Adminiſtration of publick Affairs. But ſo it is, that a Denunciation cannot be either legal or authentick, unleſs it doth proceed from a Sovereign Authority. <hi>Grotius lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de Jure Belli.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>Secondly, It was ſpoken meerly by way of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, and advertiſement, by an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipated foreſight of the enſuing dangers, and not as a formal Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition duly authorized.</item>
                     <item>Thirdly, That the Caſe was not yet in being, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the pretended Devolution could have any effect.</item>
                     <item>Fourthly, That it was not accompanied with any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, nor ſpecification of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, of Titles, and not ſo much as
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:101549:43"/>with the names of the Provinces to which they pretended; which was abſolutely neceſſary, to the end a Categorical Anſwer might have been given, the Caſe being underſtood.</item>
                     <item>Fifthly, That it was addreſſed to a Miniſter no ways commiſſionated to receive it, nor to enter into the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of ſo new a buſineſs, ſo ſurpriſing, and of ſo great importance.</item>
                     <item>Sixth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, That the moſt judicious Anſwer of the Queen did not ſtop the courſe of Negotiation, but on the contrary afforded them conveniencie to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe their Reaſons, to let her ſee, that by yielding up of thoſe Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which were devolved unto them by ſo clear a Right as they would perſwade it to be, ſhe did not alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate any thing of her Son's Eſtate, but performed an act of Juſtice, which would ſhelter his Minoritie from a dangerous War.</item>
                  </list>
But they were cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious enough not to enter into the particulars of the buſineſs, they ſhun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned all clearings, they would not urge that which they feared they
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:101549:44"/>ſhould obtain; and to make way for their more vaſt Pretenſions by the Right of Arms, it was requiſite to open the paſſage to them by that of the Devolution. Conſequently all thoſe pretty Reaſons which are now alledged to make the Queen's Anſwer be eſteemed an abſolute Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal, and an invincible Obſtacle to all Accommodation, behoved to be carefully reſerved, that they might not be preſented to the world but onely by the mouth of Mortar-pieces and Cannons.</p>
               <p>Meanwhile it is left to the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Readers, whether the Queen could have given a more equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, moderate and prudent Anſwer. Hardly were her firſt Tears dried up which the death of her dear Husband brought ſo abundantly from her eyes, ſcarcely had ſhe taken the moſt ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marie informations of the Affairs of the Court and Kingdom; when, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of the Aſſiſtance which ſhe ought to have expected from a Prince ſo nearly allied, ſhe ſaw her
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:101549:44"/>ſelf entertained in place of the firſt Complements by a Propoſition with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out form, which was not addreſſed unto her, which was introduced by an indirect and unwarranted way, by which they required from her Provinces without naming them, without ſpecifying the Cauſes, or backing them with other Reaſons then thoſe of Buying the Conſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Peace, whereof the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe had been ſold unto us at ſo high a rate. What other Anſwer could ſhe make, but that ſhe was not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of that Right, that ſhe was but a bare Regent, and had no pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to alienate any of her Son's Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions?</p>
               <p>Was it not incumbent to <hi>France</hi> to let her ſee the Grounds of this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion, and that ſhe ſhould not alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate any thing by reſtoring to every one his own? Do they think that this was a Proceſs which could ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily be decided by Bill and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer? and that upon their ſingle aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion denuded of all manner of Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:101549:45"/>ſhe would out of a frolick throw at their faces Eight of the moſt flouriſhing and rich Provinces of the ancient Patrimonie of her Familie? Meanwhile upon this they raiſe the Hue and cry, they take her Reaſons for Refuſalls, they do not reply to them but by Arms, and let her not know what it is they pretend, untill they find themſelves in a poſture able to ſnatch it away by force. It is farther to be obſerved here, that this Anſwer was not addreſſed to the Queen, nor given in form of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, but onely in the ſimple terms of an Inſtruction to the Marqueſſe <hi>de la Fuente,</hi> in order to his particular Direction, that he might try by his prudence gently to divert by a Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſo ſolid the mind of the moſt Chriſtian King from a thought ſo little ſuiting with his own Glory.</p>
               <p>For the laſt condition of a juſt War, all Lawyers do require a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Declaration by a publick De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree legally intimated to the parties. It is an eſſential condition which the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:101549:45"/>Law of Nations doth preſcribe, and all Wars deſtitute of this Formalitie are Robberies, except the urging ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of repelling force by force ſhall diſpenſe with us therein by the Law of Nature.</p>
               <p>It ſeems that <hi>France,</hi> not to forget any thing which might render her Attempt more unjuſt and ſcandalous, would needs omit this Formalitie, to make her acting the more unſeemly, by publiſhing in her Declarations, that ſhe had no deſign to break the Peace, at the ſame time when ſhe did make us feel all the effects of a War. From whence it muſt be concluded, that in regard this Anſwer cannot be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted a Refuſal, ſince there was no form in the Demand, and at the moſt cannot paſs but for a ſimple ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of Right, which the Queen did object to defend that of her Son, there cannot be in it any title for a juſt War; ſeeing the Laws do not permit even bare Repriſals, but when the partie required doth ſhut up all the ways by which Juſtice can
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:101549:46"/>be obtained. <hi>L. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lp. ff. de cond. in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deb.</hi> And ſince they have been an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered by a juridick Reaſon, it was the part of the moſt Chriſtian King to overturn it by a ſtronger, before he come to extremities.</p>
               <p>This Denunciation is not onely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary and requiſite by the Law of Nations, but alſo is expreſly ſtipula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the XXVI. Article of the Treatie of Peace, wherein it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed, <hi>That if any Rupture ſhall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards happen betwixt the two Crowns, (which God forbid) there ſhall always ſix months time he given on the one part as well as the other, to retire and tranſport their goods and perſons, &amp;c.</hi> Which of abſolute ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity requires a legal and prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Denunciation, without which they can never be able to know when it ſhall be time to retire them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and ſhall finde themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved in an unforeſeen War.</p>
               <p>It is not ſufficient to be indued with Sovereign Authority, that he may have right to make War in all ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes;
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:101549:46"/>but the action he doth intend to purſue by Arms muſt be of ſuch qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity that he may act in it as Sovereign, that is, that he act on the behalf of ſome publick Intereſt which concerns the Sovereigntie; and in this caſe his power is to be regulated by the nature of the Sovereigntie, or of that Right whereby he acts: ſo that if in this action he depends upon the Civil Laws, and be ſubject to a ſuperiour power, what Sovereigntie ſoever he does otherwiſe poſſeſs, he hath not the right of making War, but ought to have recourſe to thoſe Tribunals before which the Cauſe is to be deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and is not in this reſpect conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red but as a private perſon. <hi>Grotius lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> II. <hi>de Jure Belli.</hi> Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence confirms this every day. It is for this that the Fiſcal is inſtituted, principally to defend and purſue the particular Actions of Kings by the waies and forms of Juſtice: and this Cuſtome would be unprofitable, if Princes were both Judges and Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of their own Cauſes. They them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:101549:47"/>plead every day againſt their own Subjects, they ſubmit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the Decrees of their Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals; and if they do obſerve this Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice toward their Inferiours, they are much more obliged to keep it toward the direct Lord of thoſe Fiefs which they do claim. The reaſon is, becauſe that War is of the Law of Nations, and ſuch like Actions are of the Civil Law; That the Magiſtrates and Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunals are eſtabliſhed to hinder parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Violences, which otherwiſe would reign in the World, if it were indifferently permitted to ſeek ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction by Arms: From whence it follows, that when the way of Civil Law is open, and that he who intends the Action is ſubordinate in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular caſe to a Superiour Authority, he hath not the right of Arms in his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and cannot of himſelf have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to the Right of Nations, nor act as a Soveraign, in regard he is none in this caſe.</p>
               <p>Now in this Action the moſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an King (as the Libell it ſelf doth
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:101549:47"/>declare) doth act in no other quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie but as proſecuting the Actions of the Queen his Wife, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently cannot have in that any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Right or qualitie then that which is competent to her ſelf. Therefore in this qualitie either he doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed as actual Duke of <hi>Brabant,</hi> and Prince of the other Provinces, which he claims by a real Action, as Lord of thoſe Lands by virtue of a devolved Succeſſion; or onely as having a Right to claim them. In both caſes it is certain that he is not Poſſeſſour, that his Right is not without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie, that another is in the peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able poſſeſſion, founded upon very plauſible Titles, and that if even the moſt Chriſtian King had by violence thruſt him out of his poſſeſſion, the Judges could not pronounce any thing in the principal matter, unleſs the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs were reſtored to its firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. This is a Principle in Law which no Lawyer will call in queſtion.</p>
               <p>It is likewiſe moſt certain, that in the qualitie of Duke of <hi>Brabant</hi> he
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:101549:48"/>cannot claim his Right by Arms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a peaceable and ancient Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſour, ſeeing he depends upon a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour Power, to whoſe Judgement he is bound to ſubmit: That his Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on being a Right undecided and in controverſie, he cannot take poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on without a deciſive Sentence, nor conſequently eſtabliſh fully his Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction in that Dutchie without doing Homage to the direct Lord, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Inveſtiture from him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>France</hi> it ſelf will not deny that the Dutchie of <hi>Brabant,</hi> and the moſt part of the other Provinces which ſhe pretends to, are Fiefs depending upon the Empire, which ſhe her ſelf doth ſeem of her own accord to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge very clearly by theſe words, which ſhe hath inſerted in the end of her Preface; <hi>That his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is to poſſeſs the Eſtates which are fallen to the Queen in the</hi> Low-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, <hi>by the ſame Title by which the Catholick King hath poſſeſſed them in reference to the Empire.</hi> She declares it yet more openly in the ſame Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bells,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:101549:48"/>wherein for a principal founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the pretended Devolution of the Sovereigntie of <hi>Brabant,</hi> ſhe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges the Decree of the Emperour <hi>Henry,</hi> in favour of Prince <hi>Henry,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Father. Though I ſhall an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer this Objection in its proper place, for the preſent it's ſufficient I draw this advantage from it, that ſhe doth acknowledge the Emperour for the ſupreme and lawfull Judge of the Differences which may ariſe for the Sovereigntie of <hi>Brabant,</hi> and even in this particular caſe, which they draw by the hair to that of the Devolution; and that the ſaid Emperour <hi>did prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit the Duke to undertake any thing in it to the prejudice of his Children.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Author of this Writing pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends fully to eſtabliſh the Emperour's Right of Judging, pronouncing, and interdicting, which are all effects of a Supreme Authority. And though in that there may be many exceptions and limitations, without farther exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining the matter, we will be content in this place to make uſe of their own
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:101549:49"/>Allegations', to fight them with their own Weapons; ſo much the rather, becauſe the Privileges granted to the Dutchies of <hi>Brabant, Limbourg,</hi> and the other Provinces of the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> by the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the IV, <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſmond, Maximilian,</hi> and others, evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently confirm that a part of <hi>Brabant</hi> and of the other Provinces hold of the Empire: beſides, it is ſet down in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs terms, that the ſaid Provinces <hi>are Fiefs of the Empire.</hi> No perſon is igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant that they compoſe one<note n="*" place="margin">The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into Circles.</note> Circle of it, and conſequently that for what concerns publick Right they are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the Laws, reſerving neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs their particular Privileges and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction.</p>
               <p>It is out of controverſie that all the Proceſſes and Differences which ariſe touching Succeſſions, Inveſtitures, Rights, and Pretenſions upon Fiefs of the Empire, depend of the Supreme Juriſdiction of the direct Lord, and that no Prince of this great Body can ſeiſe the Eſtates of another by way of fact, what juſt Pretenſion ſoever
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:101549:49"/>he may have, without contravening the Order and Imperial Conſtitutions, and obliging all the other Princes to take Arms againſt the Aggreſſour. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience ſhews us this in an infinitie of Proceſſes of this nature, which are ſtill depending before their lawfull Tribunals. As alſo no body will deny but that the Treaties of <hi>Munſter</hi> and <hi>Oſnabrug</hi> are made uſe of at this day as a Fundamental Law to regulate the Affairs of the Empire: And this is expreſsly declared, <hi>Inſt.

<pb n="79" facs="tcp:101549:51"/>Empire in the fruition of thoſe E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, when they do violate them all by the Invading of this Circle? All the Pretenſions of the Princes of the Empire one againſt another have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies been left to the Supreme Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory; they have ever been begun by ſome Proceſs: And thoſe who, wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with their tediouſneſs, have la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to right themſelves, have ſtill found oppoſition, and been diſcoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced by the<note n="*" place="margin">Which is the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Diet.</note> General Diet. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven they who have carried Arms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Empire have never been condemned, nor expoſed to the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Outlawrie, but according to the forms of Juſtice. This courſe is ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated and ſo confirmed by Cuſtom, that amongſt ſo many Differences of which <hi>Germanie</hi> is full, and in the numberleſs multitude of noble Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies which compoſe this great Body, not ſo much as one is to be ſeen which hath ſtrayed from this High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way without puniſhment. <hi>France</hi> alone, which is yet but upon the Threſhold of the Door, will already
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:101549:52"/>command within the Houſe, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any form of Proceſs erects to herſelf a Tribunal of her Throne, Advocates of her Army, and Judges of her own Power. What can the Empire expect from her Submiſſion when ſhe is Miſtreſs, if ſhe make ſuch uſe of it when ſhe is but a Pretender? And how ſhould one promiſe to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the Fealtie of Vaſſalage from thoſe who commit an act of Felony to acquire it, and will not enter but by the oppreſſion of Laws and Juſtice?</p>
               <p>From all theſe Principles, which are clearer then the day, this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion may be drawn, That the Oath and the Acknowledgement which they exact from his Catholick Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie's Subjects is a Seditious practice, contrary to the Right of Nations, which ſhocks both their Duty and their Conſciences, and which no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy can take without making them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves guilty of a Crime againſt God, of Rebellion againſt their Prince, and of Baſeneſs as to themſelves; though we ſhould continue ſtill in the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:101549:52"/>ſuppoſition that the Pretenſion of the moſt Chriſtian King were equitable. I ſhall prove this by five convincing Reaſons.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>The firſt is, That they are at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent tied to the King of <hi>Spain</hi> by a ſolemn Oath with which they cannot diſpenſe of themſelves.</item>
                  <item>The ſecond is, That this Oath is valid and lawfull, being founded upon the authentick Titles of the perpetual order of the Succeſſion of their Dutchie, upon the Imperial Inveſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, upon the Queen's Renunciation, upon the <hi>Pyrenean</hi> Treatie, and upon the Teſtament of the late King.</item>
                  <item>The third is, That it hath been tendred ſince the Caſe of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Devolution happened, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Oppoſition made by the moſt Chriſtian King, or Proteſtation to the contrary, which might have put them into the leaſt doubt of the validity of their Oath: And in ſuch like pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Acts which are of conſequence the ordinary Rule is, <hi>Qui tacet, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentit.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:101549:53"/>
                  <item>The fourth is, Becauſe there is neither previous Judgment nor Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to the contrary, which can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe with them in their natural Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation.</item>
                  <item>The fifth is, That what Pretenſion ſoever may be moved againſt a Prince that is in actual poſſeſſion, the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects are not Judges in this Cauſe, but are bound to keep their Fidelity to him to whom they have ſworn it, either till he himſelf diſpenſe with them, or that ſome ſuperiour Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity decide the matter: otherwiſe it would be a Levity of moſt pernicious example for all the Subjects of other Princes, if upon the ſimple Aſſertion of the firſt comer they might have liberty to renounce their Faith, and blindly to give themſelves to whoever ſhould challenge them to be his. It would likewiſe be an intolerable Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogance in Subjects, which would overthrow all the Order of Politie and of humane Society, if they would attribute to themſelves the power of Judging Cauſes of Sovereignties: that
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:101549:53"/>ſame would not be endured even in private Succeſſions, in which the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects ought to remain under the Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of their Maſters, ſo long as they are not exempted from it by a ſuperiour Decree. We could, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this wicked Maxime, by a more ſpecious Right ſolicit the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of the Dutchies of <hi>Burgundy</hi> and <hi>Bretanny,</hi> and alſo, with a farr juſter Title, all thoſe of the Places reſigned by the laſt Peace, which <hi>France</hi> hath ſo frankly and lightly broken, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the Duty which they have promiſed to him who poſſeſſes them. We ſhould be grounded in our Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion to the Dutchie of <hi>Burgundie</hi> on a ſolemn Treatie of Peace, and for that of <hi>Bretanny,</hi> on the Right of a lawfull Succeſſion: And I am certain that if the deciſion of this Proceſs were referred to the people, they would not heſitate to declare in our favour.</item>
               </list>
               <p>'Tis a Queſtion which the Great and Supreme Arbiter of the World, our SAVIOUR, decided in the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:101549:54"/>ſame caſe, upon the captious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions of the <hi>Phariſees:</hi> Though the Right of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s, was ſubject to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Exceptions, and that his Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was not by much ſo well foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded as ours is, yet he ordained not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that the Tribute ſhould be pay'd to the preſent Poſſeſſour; to teach the people, that it did not belong to them to judge of the Right, but to yield Obedience to the party who was in actuall fruition of the Sovereignty, who bore the marks and the Character, and exerciſed the Juriſdiction thereto belonging.</p>

               <head>ARTICLE IV.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>That the Renunciation of the <hi>French</hi> Queen is juſt, irrevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable, neceſſary, and uſefull to the Publick good, nor contains in it ſelf any cauſe of Nullity or Laeſion; and that the Queen of <hi>France</hi> hath been duely Doted.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>HAving made known the Injuſtice of the Proceeding; it remains to make evident that of the Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. I ſhall conform my ſelf upon this Subject to the Method which they have obſerved in their Libells, that I may not loſe ſight of them. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they do attaque the Strength of the place, they have employed all their force to take the Outworks: and ſeeing that the <hi>Renunciation</hi> of the Queen of <hi>France</hi> was a Barricado which hindred them in their appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches unto it, they have employed
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:101549:55"/>their moſt powerfull Engines to blow it up; without conſidering that by deſtroying that Work, they over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the Foundation of a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie which hath given them ſuch great Advantages over our Monarchie, and deprive themſelves of all the Rights to thoſe Provinces which by this Peace they had acquired, ſo that they can neither poſſeſs nor retain them henceforwards without manifeſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice, unleſs they acknowledge the Principles on which their Poſſeſſion was eſtabliſhed; their own Mine doth fall back upon themſelves. If the Renunciation ſhould be null, the <hi>Pyrenean</hi> Treatie muſt be ſo too; eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing muſt be brought back to it's primitive Integritie: They can no longer make uſe of the Inſtrument of Peace, to ſecure and render their Conqueſts lawfull; they repoſſeſs us again in all our Rights; and all the Fruits which they have gathered from that Tree, of which they endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to cut up the Root, are but ſo many goods ill purchaſed.</p>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:101549:55"/>
               <p>Here it muſt be acknowledged that the Flattery of thoſe Writers is very inconſiderate, and that they have applied themſelves more to a petty litigious Intereſt then to the Glory of their Prince; they cannot contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert upon the Queen's Renunciation without calling the ſincere Faith of their King into queſtion. The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage was concluded upon the ground of the Renunciation, and the Peace upon that of the Marriage: all theſe things have an inſeparable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion. His moſt Chriſtian Majeſtie was aſſiſted in this occaſion by the moſt expert and the ableſt Miniſters of his Kingdom, who could not be ignorant whether the Infanta had power to renounce lawfully or not: This Work was premeditated, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated and concerted amongſt the Parties by a long Negotiation, which gave occaſion to all the reflexions upon Law and Policie which the cleareſt Wits could frame in ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant a matter. If then they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered that Truth which ſince they
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:101549:56"/>would make paſs for ſo clear and pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable, That this Act of Renunciation could not be valid, either they muſt confeſs that they have been the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of a ſignal Cheat, by Treating upon this Foundation, approving it, accepting it, and inſerting it into the Treatie of Peace by an expreſs Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle, promiſing to cauſe it to be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtred amongſt the Acts of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament of <hi>Paris,</hi> and authorizing it by their Oath; or elſe they muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe themſelves of Ignorance, in not having underſtood before they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded the buſineſs thoſe Nullities which at preſent do appear ſo evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent unto them. To what condition go they to reduce the Affairs of the World, if the ſolemn Treaties made betwixt ſuch Great Monarchs, for the univerſal Benefit of Chriſtendom, the Repoſe of the People, and the Securitie of the neighbouring States, are found expoſed to mental Reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, and all the Subtilties of the Barr? And if ordinary Merchants, onely for the good of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:101549:56"/>have the liberty to form to themſelves a Right, and particular ſtyle, which ſhelters them from the Intrigues of the Palace; would it be convenient that Sovereign Princes in publick Treaties, which do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the publick good, ſhould not be exempt from that ſubjection? If this pernicious Maxime be once eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, of reducing the publick Right to the condition of private Right, we ſhall quickly ſee as many Wars ariſe amongſt Princes as there be Suits of Law amongſt Citizens.</p>
               <p>To diſcourſe to the bottom upon this matter, we muſt deduce ſome circumſtances of Fact, which are moſt neceſſary to give it a full clearing.</p>
               <p>When <hi>France,</hi> rather wearied then ſatiated with War, did reſolve to liſten to the Propoſitions of the Peace, and that their domeſtick Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders did oblige them to clear themſelves from foreign buſineſs, that they might reform thoſe Abuſes which undermined them at home, the wiſeſt Stateſmen both of the one and
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:101549:57"/>the other ſide did conceive by a pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent foreſight, that nothing could be ſolidly and durably treated of,<note place="margin">This is proved by the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Peace, and the Article of Renun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation.</note> if the Root of the Miſchief were not pulled up, and if ſome effectual means were not found out, not onely to ſtifle all the Differences paſt, and prevent thoſe to come, but alſo to extinguiſh, by a real and undiſſolvible Union, the ancient Emulation of the two Crowns, and the natural Antipathy of the two Nations: that all other Dreſſings could never reach the bottom of the Wound, and would prove but Leni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to mitigate the pain for a time, without taking away the Cauſe of the Evil. Having long ſearched for Expedients anſwerable to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of the Deſign, none was thought proper but that of a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage between the moſt Chriſtian King and the moſt Serene Infanta <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Tereſa,</hi> to joyn the Seal of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament to that of the Treaties, Love to Concord, and Alliance to Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Spain,</hi> which deſired the Peace, but
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:101549:57"/>yet withall wiſhed to have it firm and inviolable, judged, with reaſon, that this was the onely mean to remedy all thoſe Miſchiefs which the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Oppoſition of thoſe two great Poles of Chriſtendom had occaſioned for the ſpace of ſo many years: but in this ſhe found an eſſential Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie proceeding from the Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietie of the Fundamental Laws of the one and the other Realm in two principal Points. Though thoſe of <hi>Spain</hi> do always prefer Males in the Succeſſion, they do notwithſtanding leave the Gate open for Daughters, failing the Heirs Male in the ſame Line. Thoſe of <hi>France,</hi> quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, do perpetually exclude the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males, and to their prejudice make the Right of Succeſſion paſs even to Strangers.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is, That one of the moſt ancient Conſtitutions of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchie of <hi>Spain,</hi> on which they lay all the foundation of their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is, that their Kingdom is not Alienable, that they live always un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:101549:58"/>their own peculiar Kings, and that their Crown can neither be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed nor incorporated with any other. That of <hi>France,</hi> on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, doth arrogate unto it ſelf this Right, (as it appears by their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and Lawyers) That whatſoever is poſſeſſed or acquired by the Kings of <hi>France</hi> by any kind of Title doth fall to the Crown, is the proper Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of it, and can never more be diſmembred from it, and ought to be ſubject to the ſame Laws and form of Government as their own King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, as well in relation to the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Succeſſion, as to what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns the publick State. So that in caſe the Monarchie of <hi>Spain</hi> ſhould fall by Marriage or otherwiſe under the power of a King of <hi>France,</hi> ſhe would become a member and an inſeparable Acceſſorie of <hi>France;</hi> ſhe would be reduced to the ſame condition with <hi>Bretannie</hi> and other Provinces, and failing of lawful Succeſſors in her Line, it would paſs to the Collate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, and to all thoſe who ſhould at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:101549:58"/>to the Throne of the <hi>Flower-de-luces.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All <hi>French</hi>-men are ſo unanimous in this Pretenſion, that it would be ſuperfluous to prove it to them; though it would not be hard to impugn it. But 'tis a Maxime re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived amongſt them, of which they have put themſelves in poſſeſſion by a long abuſe, and which they are reſolved ſtubbornly to maintain in all manner of Rencounters.</p>
               <p>This Incompatibility held for a while the Council of <hi>Spain</hi> in ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence; they wiſhed Peace, yet would not buy it at the price of ſo hard a Servitude; and the Directours of ſo many Kingdoms could never have perſwaded themſelves to become Subjects of another Realm, nor to ſee their Ruling Crown reduced to a Province.</p>
               <p>The Queen-Mother of <hi>France,</hi> who with the tender feelings both of a Mother and an Aunt paſſionately and with ardour wiſhed ſo fair and ſo fitting an union of two Perſons
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:101549:59"/>which were ſo dear unto her, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied all her cares to remove thoſe Hinderances, and this temperating mean was found out to ſecure the reaſonable Doubts of the Council of <hi>Spain,</hi> That by the Contract of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, the Infanta ſhould abſolutely renounce all kind of Rights which ſhe might ever pretend either upon the whole or the parts of this great Succeſſion, under any Title or Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text whatſoever which at any time ſhe might have thereunto, to the end that in no caſe the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Monarchy might either be ſubject or diſmem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred.</p>
               <p>And both ſides the willinglier con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to this Expedient, in regard that the way had already been beaten by the example of the Queen-Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>France,</hi> and that in effect the Renunciation which ſhe made was of the ſame nature with this preſent one, both in the form and in the ſubſtance, as being founded on the very ſame cauſe of the Incompatibilitie of theſe two Succeſſions. This Marriage, and
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:101549:59"/>conſequently this Renunciation, which was the ground-ſtone of it, hath been ſo much celebrated by the <hi>French</hi> Authors, that in the Book of <hi>James de Bie</hi> of <hi>France Metallick</hi> is ſeen ingraven on the backſide of a Medall of Gold <hi>Lewis</hi> the XIII<hi rend="sup">th</hi> holding <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of <hi>Auſtria</hi> by the hand, with this Inſcription, <hi>AETER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NAE FOEDERA PACIS.</hi> But the rapid motion of <hi>France</hi> is inconſiſtent with the fixed point of Eternity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Spain,</hi> which preſuppoſed the ſame Sinceritie to be in others which ſhe found in her ſelf, gave ear to this Offer, believing that by this Precau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the Laws of <hi>Spain</hi> might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled with the <hi>Salique</hi> Law, and the Liberty of their People and the Authority of their ancient Government be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſecured. <hi>France,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">It is certain by the Act of Renunciation, and by the Contract of Marriage, that in Agreement be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="4 letters">

                     </gap>t the two Kings did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede the ſaid Renun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation.</note> which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged that the thing was juſt, and had been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly in uſe, put her hands fully to it, becauſe of the great good which would redound unto her by
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:101549:60"/>a Peace which did eſtabliſh her in ſo many Conqueſts. The Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it was drawn by common Conſent, and the moſt Chriſtian King obliged himſelf to Ratifie it, and cauſe it to be Enrolled in the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Paris,</hi> preſently after the Marriage. And this Agreement was all the Foundation of the Peace, which was immediately thereafter concluded.</p>
               <p>Things being thus concerted bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ween the Parties, the King, who had a Paſſion for this Princeſſe which ſurpaſſed all the Reaſons of State, would conclude nothing without her Approbation, and therefore did put into her hands the deciſion of her Fortune: On the one ſide he repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to her the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> and the Perſon of the moſt Chriſtian King, with all the Advantages which do render him ſo worthy of eſteem; and on the other ſide a doubtful Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion (which indirectly looked to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards her,) to one of the greateſt and moſt powerful Monarchies of the
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:101549:60"/>World; Made known to her thoſe irrevocable Laws, which could not ſuffer that theſe two Kingdoms ſhould be united into one, and did not permit that ſhe ſhould retain her hopes and her Rights in the one, if ſhe preferred to it the poſſeſſion of the other; That he left it to her en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire diſpoſition, to chuſe of theſe two incompatible things that which ſhe ſhould find moſt agreeable to her <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> and moſt ſuitable to her For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.</p>
               <p>This Generous Princeſs, who had been educated in an Inclination for <hi>France,</hi> and had a ſufficient eſteem for the Perſon of the moſt Chriſtian King, to prefer it before all the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of the World, and who, ſtung with a very noble Ambition not to deſpiſe ſo beautiful a Throne as that of <hi>France,</hi> did not ſtick to embrace the better and the more advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Bargain: She freely renounced what could never be hers, but by the death of thoſe whom ſhe loved as much as her ſelf, to accept of a Good
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:101549:61"/>much more precious in her eſteem then that which ſhe abandoned; ſhe quitted the doubtful and the future for what was certain and preſent, hopes for realities, and renounced moſt generouſly thoſe Pretenſions which ſhe abhorred, ſince they were but impediments to the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of her deſires and to her good fortune. Nor can it be doubted of without doing her injury, but that if it were yet at her election to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enter again into her Rights by quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Good ſhe doth poſſeſs, ſhe would as willingly ratifie this Act to keep and enjoy it, as ſhe did freely ſign to obtain it.</p>
               <p>Upon this true Narration, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Act of Renunciation, as alſo upon the XXXIII. Article of the Treatie of Peace, divers Reflexions may be made, and Principles eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, which will overthrow from the foundations all thoſe of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary partie.</p>
               <p>The firſt is, That this Treatie of Marriage, and this Renunciation, is
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:101549:61"/>an eſſential member of the Peace; and though they be digeſted into different Inſtruments, they do all notwithſtanding make up but one Treatie, as it is expreſly declared in the ſaid XXXIII. Article, wherein ſpeaking of the Contract of Marriage to which they refer themſelves, theſe words following are added; <hi>Which though it be ſeparated, hath the ſame force and vigour that the preſent Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Peace hath, as being the principal part thereof, and the moſt precious Pawn of its greater ſecurity and laſting.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, That as well the ſaid Treatie of Peace as that of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage are Contracts of ſincere Faith, and not of ſtrict Law; and that for the rule and ground of their ſubſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and Interpretation, we muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre our ſelves to the Cauſes and Ends which both ſides did propoſe to themſelves in Treating, and the Uti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie which ariſes from thence to the publick good.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, That theſe are Treaties betwixt two Great Monarchs, who
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:101549:62"/>are not ſubject to any particular Laws,<note place="margin">It is clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Act of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> nor dependent on the Cuſtoms of Places: That they are fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Laws of the one and the other State, which are not to be meaſured but by the Laws of Nations; 'tis a natural Obligation which they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, which cannot be broken by any Civil Law;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>I.</hi> Jura na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turae de Reg. Jur.</note> it is properly the indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſable Law of Sovereigns, which they can never violate nor alter with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Injuſtice, nor correct but by common Conſent. They are above particular Laws, they can change and augment them at their pleaſure, as the Codes <hi>Henry</hi> and <hi>Lewis:</hi> But theſe which tie them to an Equal with a reciprocal knot, and which are the foundation of the publick Tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, can never receive any other form then that which the publick Seal hath imprinted upon them.</p>
               <p>The Princes who are abſolute So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereigns, when they do act as ſuch, have but two ways to terminate their Quarrels, Arms and Treaties. The firſt is but a means to attain to the
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:101549:62"/>other: but if the latter have not a ſolid and immovable foundation, and if it be permitted to break it upon the leaſt Subtilities of private Right, there is no more Securitie in the World; and it is to reduce it to its firſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, which gave occaſion to the bringing in of Kings and Magiſtrates, to hinder that force might not be the ſole Arbiter of Differences. Now as Princes are eſtabliſhed to remedy this diſorder among their Subjects, ſo are Treaties likewiſe introduced to work the ſame effect among Princes; ſo they are their Judges and their Magiſtrates, to which they ought en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely and abſolutely to ſubmit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as they pretend that their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Subjects are ſubmitted to them. <hi>France</hi> admits of no Preſcription to the prejudice of the Royal Domaine, ſhe receives no Judges nor Proceſſes; there is nothing then but publick Treaties which can bound her Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions, which do extend themſelves almoſt over all <hi>Europe.</hi> If ſhe be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to exclude even this, there will
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:101549:63"/>be no other means remaining but that of Force, which ſilences all Laws, and Kings ſhall put themſelves abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely out of all Commerce.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, That this Renunciation is the Soul and the inſeparable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of this Treatie of Marriage, without which it had never been ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deſigned or concluded, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently the Treatie of Peace; as is expreſſed in the Article before cited.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, That it proceeds not from the bare motion of the deceaſed King, or a particular inclination of his towards the Children of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Bed; but out of an inevitable Neceſſity flowing from the <hi>Salique</hi> Law, and the unjuſt Extention which <hi>France</hi> doth make of it to all the States which Fortune hath put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her power: this Neceſſitie, and the other of the Publick good, with the conſervation of this Auguſt Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milie, reduced the Infanta to the condition of never being able to be Queen of <hi>France,</hi> but by this Renun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation.</p>
               <pb n="103" facs="tcp:101549:63"/>
               <p>Sixthly,<note place="margin">This is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident by the Act of Renuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>fol.</hi> 17.</note> That there's no conſtraint nor violence on her Father's part, whoſe Sweetneſs and natural Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration have ſo eminently ſhined throughout the whole courſe of his life, not onely towards his faithful Subjects, but likewiſe towards his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies and Rebells, that many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it did reach unto exceſs. It is not to be preſumed that the ſame heart which had in it an inexhauſtible treaſure of Bountie toward all the reſt of the World, ſhould have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Rigour and Hardneſs for a Daughter who was the Centre of his choiceſt delights. If there had been any Conſtraint, the effects would have been ſeen by ſome Complaint or Action of the Infanta's; and if her reſpect to her Father did hold them up, her Diſcontent would have appeared in her eyes and in her face: the troubles of the Soul, what care ſoever is taken to hide them, do im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>print a character outwardly which betrays the ſecret of the Heart. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was any ſeen to go to a Wedding
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:101549:64"/>with more viſible ſigns of ſatisfaction: She ſigned this Act with ſo pleaſant a Reſolution, that it was eaſie to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve ſhe much more eſteemed what ſhe was to acquire, then what ſhe loſt thereby; and the Tears which ſhe ſhed at this day for this War, of which, againſt her mind, they do make her the innocent Pretext, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſufficiently that ſhe diſapproves of the Cauſe of it as much as ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſts the Effects, and are authentick ratifications of the free Conſent which ſhe gave to this Renunciation. If ſhe had done it unwillingly, ſhe would not have failed to have made Proteſtations againſt it, as ſoon as ever ſhe found her ſelf in a condition to declare without fear and with the applauſe of all <hi>France</hi> the true thoughts of her minde. She her ſelf will confeſs, without doubt, that it was neither Reſpect, nor Obedience, no nor Complacencie, but the free choice of her own Inclination and Prudence: That the King her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther neither employed his Paternal
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:101549:64"/>power, nor Royal Authority, nor Command, nor Threats, nay not ſo much as Perſuaſions, to induce her thereunto; but that he ſatisfied himſelf by propoſing nakedly the ſtate of Buſineſs to her, that he might leave to her ſelf the entire deciſion: That of the two parts ſhe made choice of the moſt advantagious, and the moſt fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting: That ſhe never repented of this Choice, and would to day doe the ſame thing again without any kind of heſitation, if ſhe were in the ſame condition in which ſhe was then. From whence it may be concluded, that this Act having been made with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any kind of Fear or Violence, it cannot be called in queſtion by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of any exception of the Civil Laws. <hi>Qui metum non intendit, Promiſſio validè fiet; nec ſcrutabimur quid aut quatenus ejus interſit, quae Juris Romani ſunt ſubtilitates.

               </p>
               <p>Seventhly, That there is no Laeſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſeeing that ſhe acquires a greater Benefit then that which ſhe hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:101549:65"/>not being able to poſſeſs them both together by an irremedia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble repugnancie. It was then a kind of Permutation, rather then a Ceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, becauſe ſhe gave to obtain, and quitted to get. The Laws give no riſe to an entire Reſtitution, where the condition of the Minor is rendred more advantagious by the Contract, and do permit in this caſe Alienations even of the Goods of Pupills. It is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt impracticable in the Contracts of Kings, to prove the Laeſion, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine the legal Portion with its juſt weight, which cannot be verified but by the valuation of the Goods; the inevitable Expences muſt be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted, and the neceſſary Charges: their affairs are involved into ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Intrigues, charged with ſo many Obligations and Coſts, that to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it in its rigour there remains very little unto them whereof they can freely diſpoſe; and by the ordinary Rules it is impoſſible to ſet a price upon their Eſtates. It is for this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that they are accuſtomed, by a
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:101549:65"/>practice received among Monarchs, to give unto the Daughters a certain ſumme of Money, which ſerves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of a legal Portion, without ever coming to any other rating of Goods, which cannot be juſtly valued. The moſt Chriſtian Kings do practice this towards the Daughters of <hi>France.</hi> He of <hi>England</hi> uſed the ſame way towards the Dutcheſs of <hi>Orleans;</hi> our King to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his: The Princes of <hi>Italie</hi> and <hi>Germanie</hi> have the ſame Cuſtome, without ever ſpeaking of Supple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, legal Portions, or Laeſions, which are properly the Actions of private perſons, unworthy the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Monarchs, who never act for Profit, but for Reaſon of State.</p>
               <p>Moreover, we muſt conſider (as I have ſaid) this Marriage not as a private Contract, but as a Member of the Treatie of Peace, which neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily relates to all the other Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. By the ſaid Treatie, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently in conſideration of the ſaid Marriage, are granted unto the moſt Chriſtian King a great quantity of
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:101549:66"/>Provinces and States, which do ſo notably increaſe his Dominions, much exceeding the value of whatever the Queen of <hi>France</hi> can pretend for her legal Portion: and this Conceſſion doth redound to the advantage and to the Greatneſs of the Queen of <hi>France,</hi> by that inſeparable conjunction which unites all her Husband's Intereſts with hers. Whence it follows, that this Ceſſion ought to ſuffice her in the place of her legal Portion, ſince the Marriage was made in favour of the Peace, and the Peace in conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Marriage, and that they are two indiviſible things, which could not have being the one without the other, and ſo ſtrongly chained to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, that the Conditions of the Marriage are included in the eſſence of the thing, if the Cauſe, the End, the Effects and the whole Context of the Negotiation be conſidered.</p>
               <p>'Tis in vain that they alledge that they have acquired them by the right of Arms, and that they were in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to drive us to Extremities, and
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:101549:66"/>would have us eſteem it a grace to have ſpoiled us but of a half: 'tis too much to preſume on their good fortune, and to diſpoſe too abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the ſucceſs of Arms, of which God alone hath reſerved the events to his Providence. All the world knows that if the neceſſity of our Affairs had obliged us to take the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of treating with <hi>Portugal,</hi> we could have had means enough to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige <hi>France</hi> (at the leaſt) to have ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red equally the fear and the danger with us. Their People, wearied with the War, and overwhelmed with Taxes, waited onely for a turn of the Tide to take off the Maſque: the neighbouring Princes were reſolved not to ſuffer them to enlarge their Conqueſts any farther. The <hi>Tyrant</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> who made that Kingdom act againſt its own Intereſts, in favour of <hi>France,</hi> was already removed by death, and the common voice of the Nation in order to the Reeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of the Lawfull Succeſſour, enlightned with ſo many knowledges,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:101549:67"/>and endued with ſuch vigour and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, that it was not to be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but that he would ſoon put the Counterpoiſe upon our ſide, by joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his Intereſts the reſentment of a multitude of Wrongs: We were powerfully armed in all places, and in thoſe very Summers which preceded the Peace we were in a condition to carry the War home to them. The moſt penetrating among them know the ſecret motives which obliged the Cardinal <hi>Mazarin</hi> to make this Peace, and that the apprehenſion of what was to come more then any Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was the firſt mover of it.</p>
               <p>But ſetting all their Boaſtings apart, is it not a conſiderable advantage for them to have eſtabliſhed by a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie what they had conquered by Arms, to have acquired by a juſt Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle that which they could never have retained without Uſurpation, and to have freed themſelves from all the dangers and expences which were inevitable to them in keeping them?</p>
               <p>But if it be true, as they do pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:101549:67"/>that they were in a condition to diſpoſſeſs our King of his Throne; they muſt confeſs two things which are extreamly againſt them: The one, That the Marriage and Renun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation were the Safety and Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the Monarchie; and that the King could not onely have made the moſt illuſtrious Infanta renounce all her Rights upon this conſideration, but that he was bound ſo to doe by a ſtrict Obligation, ſince the Goods of private perſons belong to the Publick in caſe of ſuch neceſſities:<note place="margin">Ariſt. <hi>l.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 10.</note> that the publick good is greater and more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine then the private: that this laſt, by obligation of Conſcience, is bound alwaies to yield to the other, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the opinion of all Doctors: and that even the Infanta her ſelf,<note place="margin">Sakes popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The other is, That ſhe hath not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly done good to the Publick, but alſo
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:101549:68"/>that without betraying her ſelf ſhe could not refuſe to give her conſent to this Renunciation: her Rights and Pretenſions ſhould have been ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up in the publick Shipwreck; in vain had ſhe reſerved to her ſelf Titles, if the Arms of her Enemies were upon the point to take all from her. So that very farr from a Laeſion, ſhe may reckon for a new Purchaſe all that ſhe hath been able to ſave from this Wreck. Her Portion had been very ill aſſigned, in caſe her pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Goods had fallen into hands which cannot diſmember, alienate, nor reſtore one inch of Land. And in this caſe it is very probable that the moſt Chriſtian King would have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed the Alliance of a poor exiled Princeſs, who would not have had any other proviſion but her Vertue; and ſhe her ſelf would not have had the heart to caſt her ſelf into the arms of him whom ſhe found loaden with the Spoils of her Father. She hath redreſſed all thoſe inconveniences by this Renunciation, and opened to her
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:101549:68"/>ſelf the way to this Crown, to which we now ſee her ſo worthily elevated. What Laeſion then can there be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, when theſe two Convenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, <hi>de damno vitando &amp; lucro cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tando,</hi> do meet ſo perfectly united?</p>
               <p>Eighthly, 'Tis an affected ignorance both of Fact &amp; Law, to alledg that the Queen was under age when ſhe paſſed this Act. No body can doubt but that the Princes and Princeſſes of <hi>Spain</hi> are out of Minority before the age of Twenty years, as it is expreſsly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in the Renunciation; <hi>And as by the grace of God I do find my ſelf to be in the age of Major, and more then twenty years old.</hi> Royal Perſons are held to be out of Minority as ſoon as they have attained to the years of Youth. And though one ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the Infanta as a private perſon, and that this were to be regulated by the Laws and Cuſtomes of private Succeſſions; it is a certain truth, that by the Local Cuſtomes upon which <hi>France</hi> doth found her Right, both Sons and Daughters are Majors at
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:101549:69"/>the age of twenty years, and may free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſpoſe of their Fiefs even in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to their own life, without any Diſpenſation from the King, or autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of a Guardian.<note place="margin">L. Scio, ff. de in inc. reſt.</note> And if ſhe were under age, there muſt firſt be ſome enormous Laeſion cauſed by the Faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of her who renounces, or by the Deceitfulneſs of the other party.<note place="margin">Auth. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramento pauperum, C.

It is certain that if in this age ſhe had attained to the Succeſſion of the Kingdome, or the Provinces which they ſay do belong unto her, ſhe would have had no need either of Tutors or Governours: This Law ſuppoſes, that Nature and Education do ſooner produce in the minds of Princes thoſe fruits of Prudence, which do not grow ripe in others but by time. And if the Civil Laws diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe before the time preſcribed by Municipal Laws, touching the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectings to Minority thoſe, who by
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:101549:69"/>induſtry and aſſiduity have rendred themſelves capable to govern their own and other peoples buſineſs; it is much more juſt that ſuch as the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Laws admit without limitations and dependences to the Adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Kingdomes, may uncontrouled diſpoſe of their own concerns, though the Cuſtome which reſtricts private perſons to the age of Twenty years ſhould not be conſidered. And ſince ſhe was in a condition to enjoy the privilege of Reigning without an O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſeer, 'tis evident that ſhe had no right to enjoy the benefit of Repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; foraſmuch as the <hi>French</hi> Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians hold for an indubitable Maxime, that he Daughters which are capable of Marriage are alſo capable of any other kind of legal Deed. <hi>Du Mou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin on the Cuſtome of Blois, Art.</hi> 161.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, It is an inſupportable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury to the Memory of the late King, to accuſe him to have diſinherited his Daughter the Infanta. On his part there was no poſitive Act, more then a ſimple conſent and authorizing of
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:101549:70"/>the free Renunciation made by this Princeſs, who by a voluntary choice did preferr the Crown of <hi>France</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that of <hi>Spain,</hi> which ſhe looked upon as very remote. The Teſtament of the King is nothing elſe but a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of this ſame Deed, which he ſuppoſed to be Legal, being fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med upon the platform of thoſe things which were eſtabliſhed by the Peace. And if the Renunciation be juſt, it muſt of neceſſity follow that the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtamentarie diſpoſition, which is but a conſequence of it, is ſo likewiſe. All the vain Exclamations which the Authors of theſe Libells do make up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that Subject are but the extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant digreſſions of an affected Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to aſtoniſh the people. 'Tis the like too of all thoſe majeſtical Conſequences which they draw from thence to exaggerate the Injuries which have been done to his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſours. If the thing be juſt in it ſelf, and received in the perſon of the Mother, it cannot be unjuſt in her Succeſſours, who have no Right but
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:101549:70"/>what they derive from her. And if it be permitted to private perſons to make Entails to the excluſion of Daughters and their offspring, in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of collateral Lines; if the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique</hi> Law may perpetually deprive them and all their Deſcendants of an Hereditary Kingdome; what Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice can be found in this, that <hi>Spain</hi> hath deſired this Renunciation, to the end they fall not into the Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencie upon a ſtranger-Kingdome? The Daulphin of <hi>France</hi> had never been in the world, nor had any ſhare in the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> if the Queen had not renounced: and if he cannot be at one time King both of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> he muſt lay the fault on the <hi>Salique</hi> Law, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours all that it poſſeſſes, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liges all other Kingdomes to provide for their own ſafety by fitting Precau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and by the natural Law, <hi>quod quiſque Juris.</hi>

               <p>The ſource which they leave for the Queen to re-enter into her Rights, in caſe that God ſhould afflict her
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:101549:71"/>with a Widowhood without Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, is an effect of the Fatherly Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs and Juſtice, which would needs eſtabliſh her Happineſs in all ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, by putting her in a condition either to reign gloriouſly in <hi>France</hi> by her Fruitfulneſs, or to have wherewithall to comfort her in caſe of Barrenneſs, by re-entring into her Rights to the Monarchy of <hi>Spain.</hi> This doth clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhew that in this Renunciation her Perſon was not regarded, but onely the Obſtacle inconſiſtent with the Reaſon of State, which did ſuſpend the effects of that Love which they had for her; and that renders the Renunciation the more valid, becauſe it is not abſolute, and leaveth the Gate ſtill open for her Re-entry as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as the eſſential Impediment ſhall not come in the way; far from wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her Barrenneſs, or excluſion of her Offspring, whenever they may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived without ſubjecting the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.<note place="margin">Inſtrument of Renun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation, <hi>fol.</hi> 13.</note> The way is opened to place her and her Succeſſours upon the Throne of <hi>Spain; If for publick Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies

               <p>Upon theſe indubitable Principles it will not be difficult to eſtabliſh and ground in Law the validity of the Queen's Renunciation upon the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Rules.</p>

               </list>
               <p>As to the firſt Point, that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution is not a Succeſſion, it is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily proved by the Cuſtoms of the Places where this Right is in force, and by the Effects both of the one and the other, which are totally dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent. Succeſſion ſuppoſes Death, and Devolution doth begin from the moment of the Diſſolution of the firſt Marriage.<note place="margin">L. qui ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puſtitis, ff. de ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir. haered.</note> There can be no
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:101549:74"/>Succeſſion to a living perſon, that were to bury the Fathers before their deceaſe, and make Children ſucceed one another in the Father's life-time, to change a Succeſſion which is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect in its own nature into a collateral one: The Grandchildren (whoſe Father died before their Grandfather) would be wholly excluded from the Inheritance; for they cannot enter by way of direct Succeſſion, becauſe it would be fallen to their Uncles or to their Aunts; nor by collateral, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they would be of an inferiour degree, and that the Feodal Cuſtom of <hi>Brabant</hi> doth not admit of Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation in indirect Succeſſions: ſo that if it were a true Succeſſion, it might happen that an Aunt would totally exclude the Son of her elder Brother, which would overthrow the whole order of the Succeſſion, and the firſt Inſtitution of the Fiefs of <hi>Brabant,</hi> where the Males of the Firſt Bed and their Deſcendents are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways preferred to the Females. It is to no purpoſe that the Authors of
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:101549:74"/>theſe Libells will make uſe upon this ſubject of ſome ill-conceived terms, and improperly applied in ſome one of the Feodal Cuſtoms, by which it ſeems that they give the name of <hi>Succeſſion</hi> to Devolution: for the ſame Feodal Cuſtoms of <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant</hi> which he cites were never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed nor approved, and thoſe which we find in print are for the moſt part but the Projects of the Lieutenant of the Fiefs of <hi>Brabant,</hi> and of ſome Practitioners who have not reflected upon the force of the words, but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been preſented to the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to be examined and decreed, the Approbation of them was refuſed, in regard they were conceived in terms not very proper. But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it be, when the Law and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome is contrary, and that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the Law or of the Cuſtome is manifeſtly known, 'tis a ridiculous thing to prefer the words before the ſubſtance, ſo much the more, becauſe the ſame Cuſtoms do explicate very clearly the Equivocation in other
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:101549:75"/>places. In the XXV. Article it is ſaid, that <hi>If the Fiefs come from the firſt deceaſed, the Proprietie ſucceeds to the Children:</hi> which evidently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth by this diſtinction, that they do not ſucceed in the Proprietie of the Goods of the Survivor; and that the one is Succeſſion, and the other Devolution. In the XXXVII. Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle alſo it is ſaid, that Feodal Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors do not aſcend, but muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways deſcend: ſo that were the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution a Succeſſion, it would paſs immediately unto the Children of the Second Bed, in caſe thoſe of the Firſt die without Iſſue: whereas 'tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain by the XXIII. Article, that they do return back to the Fathers, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that they remain free and reliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the band by which they were tied, which is rather a Settling, then a Return of the Proprietie. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe a great abſurditie muſt follow, which is, That the father would ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed as repreſenting his Son, and ſo would be obliged to renew his Inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiture, and ſwear Homage anew;
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:101549:75"/>which hath never been practiſed. Although that the enacted Cuſtomes of <hi>Lovain</hi> ſpeak very uncorrectedly, and ſeem in ſome places to confound the Devolution and the Succeſſion; nevertheleſs it may be ſeen by the coherence, that they ought to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood with different relations, and that the word <hi>Succeſſion</hi> ought to be applied to an Eſtate already fallen by the death of one of the Parents, and that of <hi>Devolution</hi> as relative to the Goods of the Survivors; ſince the Cuſtome in this place treats of the one and the other, and in others it calls the Father the <hi>Proprietarie of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe or fruits,</hi> and that they treat diſtinctly and in ſeveral Articles both of the <hi>Succeſſion</hi> and <hi>Devolution,</hi> as matters of a different nature in their Cauſe and in all their Effects. This Queſtion is ſo plainly handled in the Treatiſe of the Sieur <hi>Stockmans,</hi> chap. 5. <hi>de Jure Devol.</hi> that the Reader therein will finde wherewith to ſatisfie himſelf fully touching this particular, if he hath the curioſitie to run it over.</p>
               <pb n="128" facs="tcp:101549:76"/>
               <p>As for that which concerns the Proprietie, the Children of the Firſt Bed do not poſſeſs any effect thereof whilſt either of the eſpouſed are li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, as having neither the uſe of the fruit, nor the teſtamentarie diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, nor the right of Alienation or of Engagement, nor any other of thoſe Actions which by Law do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the Proprietor: and if they chance to die before their Father, they fall from it totally. So that all their Right conſiſts in a ſimple aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance that thoſe Goods ſhall not be alienated, and in a hope to ſucceed one day thereunto, in caſe they do out-live their Father. If they were Proprietors, they would be obliged by the ſame Cuſtome Article LII. to take the Inveſtiture from the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect Lord during the life of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; which hath never been pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed. The Father on the contrary hath all the effects of the Proprietie, with this limitation onely, that he cannot alienate to the prejudice of the Children of the Firſt Bed: that
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:101549:76"/>excepted, he enjoys, he poſſeſſes, he governs, he acts juridically in his proper name; he is not bound to make any Inventory, nor liable to give an Accompt, and hath all the real Actions, which of right cannot belong to a ſimple Uſufructuarie, and are neceſſarily annexed to the Propriety. He is not ſo bridled, but that the Alienations which he makes are valid in themſelves and ſubſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, if the Children come to die before him; though they be ſubject to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciſſion, if they ſurvive him. In a word, the Proprietie by this Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution cannot be attributed to the Children by any of the Titles of Law by which Domains are acquired: they cannot pretend to it by way of Succeſſion, as I have already ſhewn; the Devolution gives them not any effect, nor any Title; and the Father hath not loſt it by any of the ways of Alienation which the Civil Laws have preſcribed; the Death of his Wife cannot take from him the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main of his Goods,<note place="margin">L. nemo, ff. de Reg. Jur.</note> which cannot be
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:101549:77"/>loſt but by a voluntary act, as of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, Sale, Ceſſion, or Crime. Whence it ought to be concluded, that the name of Proprietie, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out abuſing the word, cannot be given to that which hath neither the effects nor the cauſe thereof; and the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome cannot, without injuſtice, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nude a Father abſolutely of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of his Goods before his Death, without his own Conſent. All theſe Truths are confirmed by ſolemn De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees, and by the unanimous Opinion of all the Doctours of the Country, as well modern as ancient, who have treated of this Subject.</p>
               <p>By all that I have ſaid it is eaſie to infer, that by renouncing the Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution we do not denude our ſelves of our proper Goods, we do not part with a Succeſſion already acquired by us, but deprive our ſelves onely of a hope, whereof the event is no leſs uncertain then the hour of our death; which is properly to renounce onely a future and doubtful Succeſſion, which is permitted by the Laws, and is in
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:101549:77"/>uſe in relation even to thoſe Goods devolved in all places where the Right of Devolution is received.</p>
               <p>If the Queen of <hi>France</hi> might law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully renounce, I do maintain that ſhe was bound to doe it by a ſtrict Obligation, for the good of the two Kingdoms, for her own good, and by a principle of Thankfulneſs for the Kindneſs of the King her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>She her ſelf profeſſes in ſeveral places of the Deed of Renunciation, that the Motives which induced her to doe it are, <hi>the Acknowledgment of the numberleſs Benefits which ſhe had received from the King her Father, the good and conſervation of his Auguſt Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milie, and the love of the Safety and Quietneſs of the State.</hi> And I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade my ſelf that ſhe ſuffered a great deal leſs Dammage and Grief by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuding her ſelf of this Right, then ſhe undergoes now by the Avidity of thoſe who would re-eſtabliſh her in it againſt her will. In effect, ſhe ſees her ſelf reduced to the neceſſity of
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:101549:78"/>deploring the Misfortunes of a Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or of a Husband; to ſee her Family overthrown, or her Throne deſtroyed: and that to which of the two ſides ſoever Victory doth lean, it cannot be but fatal to her Glorie, or to her Affection.</p>
               <p>Againſt the evidence of theſe Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities the Scribbler forms divers Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections, which are all founded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on falſe Suppoſitions in matter of Fact and Right. He cites one onely Article of the Treatie of Marriage, and draws out of it one Member to make up the whole Body of his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, without citing any thing of the Act of Renunciation. The two Reaſons which he preſſes moſt are theſe: <hi>That it is of the eſſence of a Renunciation, that a Daughter ſhould be endowed; that the Law in</hi> Spain <hi>is expreſs for it; and that if the Father gives leſs to his Daughter then her Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Part, the Renunciation is null; and that it is requiſite that her Endowment ſhould be conſtituted out of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Eſtate.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="133" facs="tcp:101549:78"/>
               <p>Upon which he makes two Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments. The one is, That the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanta hath not been endowed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the King owed to his Daughter eleven hundred thouſand Crowns of Gold of the Goods belonging to her Mother, and hath promiſed her but five hundred thouſand for her Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, obliging her to renounce that which he was indebted to her.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is, That theſe five hundred thouſand Crowns of Gold were not paid within the Term pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed; That a Portion promiſed and not pay'd is not a Portion. From whence he will inferr, that by this deficiencie the Renunciation is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nulled.</p>
               <p>Theſe two Propoſitions, which he endeavours to prove by a rabble of unuſeful Allegations, are not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended within the Fact, of which he doth craftily omit the principal Circumſtances, and touches not the eſſential point of the Queſtion: ſo that if we ſhould agree with him in his Principles, yet he could not draw
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:101549:79"/>from thence any Concluſion to our diſadvantage.</p>
               <p>In the firſt place he abuſes very improperly the terms, and the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Laws, when he ſtrains himſelf to prove that the Portion promiſed and not pay'd is not a Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; which ſhocks all the doctrine of the Law, it being indubitable that it is truly a Portion as ſoon as it is promiſed, for it induceth a real Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation upon him who did make it: <hi>Et qui habet Actionem ad Rem, Rem ipſam habere dicitur,</hi> when the Debt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or is ſufficient. This Queſtion is to be found very clearly decided in <hi>Tira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quel,</hi> and the Texts of the Law and Authors which he cites, in his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of <hi>Retract. Convent.</hi> 8.7. <hi>ad fin. tit. Gloſs.</hi> 2. <hi>num.</hi> 32. <hi>&amp; ſeqq.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the ſecond place he miſtakes himſelf, by intending to make this Renunciation paſs for a private Deed, which ought to be regulated by the Civil Laws. I have ſhewn be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that it is a publick Deed, an eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential Member of the Peace, and an
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:101549:79"/>Obligation which hath for its Cauſe the Fundamental Laws of the State, &amp; for its End the Conſervation of it: and I affirm farther, that it is a Law and a Pragmatick Sanction, eſtabliſhed by common Conſent between the two Crowns, and by the general deſire and wiſhes of the People, expreſly derogating from all particular Laws, as it is evidently ſet down in the Deed of Renunciation; ſpeaking of the Agreement made betwixt the two Kings for the Treatie of Marriage, it expreſſeth it ſelf in theſe words: <hi>And that in the V. and VI. Articles of the ſaid Treatie it is reſolved and ſettled by common Conſent, (that is to ſay, of the two Kings,) and by the ſame will, and as a thing moſt convenient, after having attentively conſidered it, &amp;c. that I, and the Children which God ſhall give us of this Marriage, ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main unable and incapable, and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely excluded from the Rights and hope to ſucceed to any of the Kingdoms, Eſtates and Seigniories, &amp;c.</hi> And a little lower it proceeds; <hi>Condeſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:101549:80"/>to this with the common deſire and wiſh of their Subjects, Vaſſals, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Lieges, who will that it have the force and vigour of a Law and prag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick Sanction, and that it be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and obſerved as ſuch.</hi> And ſome few lines after in the following §. it is added; <hi>It ſhall be agreed by Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, that their Majeſties will that it have the ſtrength and vigour of a Law eſtabliſht in favour of their Realms, and of the publick Intereſt of them, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Three lines above this he doth ſpecifie the Cauſes: <hi>Regard being had to that which imports to the publick State, and their Preſervation,</hi> (he ſpeaks of the two Crowns) <hi>that being ſo great they come not to be joyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and that the occaſions be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented that may afterwards happen of joyning them together, &amp;c.</hi> He ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes himſelf yet more clearly two pages below: <hi>Having joyntly regard to the Publick and Commons of the Realms of which God hath given him charge, the which and thoſe of the Crown of</hi>
                  <pb n="137" facs="tcp:101549:80"/>France <hi>are equally concerned that the Grandeur and Majeſtie which they have ſuſtained and preſerved for ſo many years, with ſuch good fortune and glorie to the name of their Kings Catholick and moſt Chriſtian, may not be diminiſhed nor decreaſe, as neceſſarily it would di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh and decreaſe, if by the means and by reaſon of this Marriage they ſhould come to be joyned and united in ſome of the Children or Deſcendents, the event whereof would occaſion to the Subjects and Vaſſals the Diſcontents and Afflictions which may be conſidered:</hi> and ſubſequently makes report of divers publick utilities which ariſe from this Agreement, and places it as the eſſential Foundation of the Peace and of its continuance. <hi>And to facilitate for the future the Alliances betwixt the two Crowns;</hi> which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the pretended <hi>Salique</hi> Law would render alwaies dangerous and not to be practiſed, unleſs they had agreed amongſt themſelves upon this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie, whereupon there are many things to be conſidered.</p>
               <pb n="138" facs="tcp:101549:81"/>
               <p n="1">1. That it is an Agreement made betwixt the two Kings, for the good of their Eſtates; that this Renuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is relative to the V. and VI. Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of the Treatie of Marriage which was concluded with the moſt Chriſtian King, wherein he interve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as the principal partie, as is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain by the Narrative at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the ſaid Deed. It appears alſo by the Obligation which he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes upon himſelf to ratifie it: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe if he had not acted in this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation but in the quality of a Husband, and not of a partie promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and accepting in his own name, he could not nor ought not to have ratified it, but onely to have autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized it; though he hath ratified it, as the Authour himſelf doth acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and that the Ratification of the Treatie of Peace did neceſſarily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude all that to which it was relative. Now it is uncontroverted that the two Kings by common conſent, at the deſire of their People, had power to derogate from Laws of private
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:101549:81"/>concernment, in regard they made them, and have the right of repealing them; that the Kings of <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> for cauſes of leſs importance, do not onely derogate, but change every day their Conſtitutions and Laws: and therefore that which they doe for the private reſpects of civil Juſtice, they have much more power to doe for the common good of the State: otherwiſe if they ſhould not have the power to derogate from Laws, to extinguiſh Actions, and ſtop the Proceedings of civil Juſtice by publick Treaties, they could grant no Amneſties, nor hinder the Right of the Fiſcall in the puniſhment of Crimes, nor of private perſons for the Reſtitution of what they have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the one partie from the other, nor impoſe ſilence to parties contending, nor reſtore the Goods given upon juſt Confiſcations, nor other things of the like nature, which fall out in all Pacifications, and which make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that the neceſſity and the utility of the Publick good may derogate
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:101549:82"/>from Laws when it pleaſeth the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign. As it is certain that they have had the power, it is alſo clear by the ſame Inſtrument that it was their will, and that ſuch hath been their intention. <hi>Without having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the ſaid Laws, Cuſtoms, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances and Diſpoſitions, by virtue whereof they have ſucceeded and do ſucceed to all the aforementioned King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, &amp;c.</hi> And thereafter; <hi>To which and every one of them their ſaid Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties ought to derogate in ſo farr as they ſhall be contrary, &amp;c.</hi> And more below; <hi>And that it is underſtood by the Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of this Treatie, they do derogate and hold them to be derogated.</hi> And in the V. Article it is ſaid; <hi>With De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogations and Abrogations of all and whatſoever Laws, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſages and Cuſtoms, &amp;c. from which their Catholick and moſt Chriſtian Majeſties ought to dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate, and ſhall be underſtood from this preſent to remain derogated from, &amp;c.</hi> But that which is yet of more efficacie and more conſiderable is, that in the Ratification of the Treatie of Peace
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:101549:82"/>on the part of the moſt Chriſtian King this very Derogation is expreſsly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained; <hi>Derogating to this end as we do derogate from all Laws, Cuſtoms and Diſpoſitions to the contrary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. It is certain by the Authour of the Dialogues own confeſſion, that the moſt Chriſtian King hath ratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this Agreement: 'tis in page 30. <hi>As to the Ratification of the moſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian King, it might be of ſome conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, if there were not other Nullities in the Queen's Renunciation then the defect of the Authorization of the King her Husband.</hi> Here he doth avow the Ratification, though in the ſame paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage he will needs make it paſs for a ſimple Authorization: but it is perſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuouſly ſeen by all the Clauſes of this Inſtrument, that it is an Agreement in which the moſt Chriſtian King enters as the principal partie, &amp; that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation of the Infanta hath its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning and ſource from this Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to which ſhe did willingly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent: ſo that he muſt of neceſſity ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge either that the Kings of
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:101549:83"/>
                  <hi>France</hi> have not the power to exempt themſelves and free themſelves from the Civil Laws in publick Treaties, nor to hinder the effects of them in what concerns themſelves, (which is directly againſt the uniform opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their Doctors, and offends even common ſenſe;) or that he grant that the moſt Chriſtian King, nor the Queen his Conſort, cannot make uſe to their own advantage of thoſe Actions which Law might give them, after they have derogated from them by a ſolemn Treatie. Otherwiſe men muſt renounce the faith of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and no Peace ſhall ever be ſecure, if in it the Actions competent to Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties can by no means be extinguiſhed, and if ſtill a gate be left open to the Exceptions in Law.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That theſe Writers do ſuppoſe a falſe Principle, that the Renuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was made onely in contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Portion: the Clauſes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove cited do evidently ſhew that they are miſtaken. Things muſt be looked upon in another light to judge
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:101549:83"/>ſoundly of them. The Right of Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion was an eſſential Obſtacle to the Marriage, which is certain throughout the Text of the Renun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation: The Marriage was a neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry means to the Peace; I have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy proved it by the ſame Inſtrument of Peace: The onely remedy againſt all Pretenſions was the Renunciation: to conclude the Marriage, the Obſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle was to be removed. Let us ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge then that the Renunciati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ought to hold the firſt place, as the Diſpoſitions ought to precede the Form; that it is independent of the Portion, as having different Cauſes and Ends; that it ought to have been ſtipulated before the Marriage was ever ſpoken of or the Portion. The whole Text of this Inſtrument ſhews that the Portion is in favour of the Marriage, and the Renunciation doth regard the good of the two Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies; the one being founded upon the love and natural obligation of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and the other upon publick be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit: The one is a pragmatick San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:101549:84"/>and the other not. <hi>It is agreed that the King my Lord (becauſe and in reſpect of this Marriage, and to the end that I might carrie to it my Portion and proper Goods) hath promiſed that be will give me five hundred thouſand Crowns.</hi> It ſaith not that becauſe and by virtue of the Renunciation five hundred thouſand Crowns ſhall be given, but in regard of the Marriage, which ſuppoſes that the Impediment of State ſhould be removed by the Renunciation: and thus the Cauſe of the aſſignation of the Portion is the Marriage; the End, that ſhe may carry her Portion to it. But the Cauſe and the End of the Renunciation is, <hi>For the publick good of the Kingdoms, the conſervation of the Greatneſs and the Glory of their Majeſties; to avoid the Diſcontents of the People, and the Dammages which might ariſe from thence; and to facilitate thenceforwards the Marriages between the Children and the Deſcendents of the two Kings;</hi> and laſtly, to avoid the Hinderance which Reaſon of State brought to this
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:101549:84"/>Marriage, and conſequently to the Peace. All theſe Cauſes are in their own nature irremoveable, unalter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and of abſolute neceſſity, nor can be tied to a private Deed, as is the payment of the Portion, nor li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited by any reſtrictive Conditions: and on the contrary the obligation for payment of the Portion may depend as to its execution upon many Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and the effect thereof may be ſuſpended for juſt cauſes. In the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation the Infanta hath obliged her ſelf to the whole State; in the Aſſignation of the Dowrie the King hath obliged himſelf to the moſt Chriſtian King, as the future Spouſe of his Daughter. The delay in the payment of the Portion is a prejudice in a pecuniarie matter, which may eaſilie be repaired by paying the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt which the Civil Law doth appoint after the term of payment is paſt; to ſhew that deficiencie in the payment doth not annull the Contract, ſince the Law hath provided for it by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother remedie. But the defect of
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:101549:85"/>the Renunciation would bring along with it a dammage which could never be compenſed nor repaired; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it may be judged, that it hath not nor could not be the intention of the Parties to tie the Renunciation to the payment of the Portion, and make ſo neceſſary a thing depend upon one ſo caſual, that it may be retarded by a thouſand accidents. The Renuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion alſo is conceived in terms of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preſently, and the payment of the Portion in theſe of doing here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. <hi>And from this preſent time I do hold my ſelf content and entirely paid all that belongs or may belong unto me.</hi> And as to the payment of the Portion, it is ſaid; <hi>And this Summe ſhall be paid in the manner follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It cannot likewiſe be conceived how this Scribbler dares to publiſh, that <hi>the</hi> Spaniards <hi>did make the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanta ratifie it poſteriourly to her Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, by ſome ſecret Acts which</hi> France <hi>hath never ſeen;</hi> ſeeing he himſelf doth acknowledge that the moſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:101549:85"/>King did ratifie it, and that it is expreſsly ſet down in the VI. Article of the Contract of Marriage, that the Queen ſhould paſs an Act of Renunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation <hi>before ſhe ſhall marry in words im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting the preſent time, and afterwards ſhall approve and ratifie it joyntly with the moſt Chriſtian King, as ſoon as ſhe ſhall have celebrated her Marriage.</hi> And though <hi>France</hi> had never ſeen thoſe Articles, ſhe cannot pretend any cauſe of ignorance of any of the Clauſes contained therein, ſeeing that by the ſame Article of the Treatie the moſt Chriſtian King doth conſent that this Renunciation ſhould be made <hi>in the moſt effectual and fitting form which could be for their validity and firmneſs, with the Clauſes, Derogations and Abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, &amp;c.</hi> To which in the ſame Article he conſented, and hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved them as if they had been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready made: <hi>They are held already made now for then by virtue of this Treatie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the Subtiltie of this Writer, who ſeeks by all means to faſten him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:101549:86"/>upon ſuch ſmooth ice, leaves all the Subſtance of the Caſe behind, to take hold of one word of the ſame Article, which is, <hi>providing the payment, &amp;c.</hi> and would inferr, that this Renunciation is abſolutely rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, not onely to the payment of the money, but alſo to the terms of the payment deſigned in the Second Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle; which cannot ſubſiſt without al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering the whole nature of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and giving a violent interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and oppoſite to the ſenſe and to the conception of this Article, and of the Renunciation: becauſe it is not ſaid in this place, that in caſe of pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhe ſhall renounce, but that <hi>ſhe ſhall be content with the ſaid Portion;</hi> which declares no other thing, but that when her Portion ſhall be pay'd, ſhe ſhall be content therewith, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing certain that ſhe could not be ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in this reſpect before ſhe ſhould be pay'd. So that the defect of payment within the terms mentioned gives her a juſt right to pretend to it with the Intereſts, which run from the time
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:101549:86"/>limited by the Laws, (if ſome juſt cauſe do not hinder) which regular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly would not be due without an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Promiſe, unleſs that it were in favour of the Portion, and cannot be extended farther.<note place="margin">L. <hi>1.</hi> ff. de Uſutap.</note> And albeit there ſhould be in that ſome obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of terms, it is certain that in the Interpretation of ſuch Treaties which are of upright Faith the Intention of the Parties is onely to be reſpected: ſo that the Scruples which may ariſe from the Ambiguity of the words may not prejudge the principal end. <hi>L.</hi> 1. <hi>de Legatis.</hi> And it is the more mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt in this caſe, becauſe the Renunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation ought to be made in preſent and poſitive terms before the terms of payment ſhould have been run out. Wherefore to put the Queen in the right of re-entring into all her Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions by defect of punctual payment, they ſhould have declared it by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Clauſe, which ſhould have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved thoſe Rights to the Queen in caſe of failing; the rather, becauſe in the ſame Renunciation they do ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:101549:87"/>two other caſes in which ſhe may be re-eſtabliſhed in her Rights. If the intention of the parties had been to extend it to this, they would not have failed to explain it as clearly as the reſt, being that it was as important and as likely to happen. By which it may be ſeen that this word <hi>[provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding]</hi> is no reſtrictive Condition, which ſuſpends the Act of Renunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, or which can annull it, becauſe it is not ſaid, that in caſe of payment ſhe ſhall renounce; (for in that caſe ſhe would not have been obliged to renounce till after the payment, or at leaſt under the ſame condition:) but thereby it is onely meant that ſhe ſhall content her ſelf. And he ſubjoyns the cauſe independent of the Porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; <hi>By reaſon ſhe ought to remain ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded of all of whatſoever condition or nature, &amp;c.</hi> which cannot ſignifie any other thing but that by a prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Agreement between the two Kings, for the Reaſons of State a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove mentioned, ſhe was to remain excluded. In effect, there can be no
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:101549:87"/>probability that for five hundred thouſand Crowns of Gold ſhe would ever have renounced the hopes of ſo great a Succeſſion, if ſome other more powerfull Motive had not given the weight to this Reſolution: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit even the payment of the Portion were one cauſe of the Renunciati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they cannot deny but there are others more principal and ſuperiour, which do concurr thereunto; and in this caſe reſpect is to be had to the chief and predominant, and to the End that was propoſed in this Deed.</p>
               <p>In truth it is a thing which occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons pitty to ſee this Queſtion moved between Kings, and that the ground of a War is lay'd upon a Subtiltie which private perſons durſt not diſpute in juſtice. It is certain in Law, <hi>Argumento L.</hi> 2. <hi>Cod. ff. Quando liceat ab empt. diſc.</hi> that regularly Contracts are not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nulled by the defect of accompliſhing the Conditions within the time, unleſs there be ſome expreſs and particular Clauſe annulling them in that caſe, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe the Action, competent to the
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:101549:88"/>Actor by virtue of the Contract a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him who hath not performed it would be extinguiſhed: which is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly falſe; for he who hath ſold an Inheritance,<note place="margin">L. n. ff. de Art. empt.</note> and hath not received the Price, hath right to purſue his pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and dammages, but not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract the Bargain; and he that hath not pay'd within the time ceaſes not to have a legal Action to pretend to the Inheritance by fulfilling the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract,<note place="margin">L. <hi>14.</hi> Cod. de reſc. vend.</note> and repairing the Dammage oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by the delay. It is the ſame of a Husband who demands the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,<note place="margin">L. <hi>19.</hi> ff. de obl. &amp; act.</note> who is of the ſame condition as a Purchaſour. In this point the <hi>French</hi> Lawyers do agree; and alſo upon the particular caſe of Renunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations made ſimply in contemplation of the Portion, they hold that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of payment doth not annull them: and the general Rule is, That as the ſole Conſent of the Parties conſtitutes the eſſence of Contracts, it is alſo their Conſent alone which is able to diſſolve them;<note place="margin">L. <hi>1.</hi> cod. quando lec. ab emp. diſc.</note> which hath no place neither but when things are ſtill in their integritie.</p>
               <pb n="153" facs="tcp:101549:88"/>
               <p>When the Portion hath not been pay'd,<note place="margin">L. <hi>1.</hi> cod. de dot. caut. non nuw.</note> no perſon hath right to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand it from the Husband, though in the Inſtrument (as it happens often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times) it be inſerted that it hath been received.<note place="margin">Lib. <hi>3.</hi> cod. cod.</note> And in this caſe the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band may propound his Exception, <hi>non numeratae pecuniae;</hi> of which he would have no need, if by the default of payment the Contract were an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nulled.</p>
               <p>All the Allegations which he cites upon this Subject are out of the Caſe, or elſe make againſt himſelf. That which he urges out of <hi>Baldus</hi> may help us to convince him of his errour;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Bald.</hi> in l. neque ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</note>

Reſpondeo quòd ſic, quia iſta non eſt cum effectu à Patre dotata.</hi> He doth not ſay that ſhe is not endowed, but onely that ſhe hath not received the effect of her Portion; and this Recourſe which he leaves her to the Goods of the Father for her Portion ſhews that it is truly ſettled, ſince the hath right to
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:101549:89"/>pretend to the effect of it. But that makes nothing to the prejudice of the Renunciation; on the contrary it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms it, by leaving her the right to purſue for the Portion. It is the ſame of the Allegation which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows in the Dialogue. <hi>Bened. in Cap. Raynut. in verb. Duas habens ux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ores.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Laws which he cites to prove that the Portion is not conſtituted if it be not pay'd,<note place="margin">L. <hi>1.</hi> ff. de dot. L. dotale, ff. de fun. dot.</note> and all the others, are evidently underſtood of the effects of the Portion, which fall to the charge of the Husband; it being unjuſt that be ſhould be charged with a thing which he hath not received. If pains be taken to examine theſe Laws, it will be found that they cannot be interpreted in any other ſenſe, and in effect the Portion muſt needs be conſtituted, ſince it is due, and that the Husband hath right to pretend unto it. A thing which is not cannot produce an Action. The Law which he cites, <hi>Traject. ff. de Obl. &amp; Act.</hi> is altogether out of our
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:101549:89"/>caſe, and applied beſide the purpoſe: It ſpeaks onely of Contracts where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a Penaltie is expreſly ſtipulated againſt him who fails to ſatisfie,<note place="margin">L. traject. ff. de Obl. &amp; Act. Poena (utì aſſolet) ob operas ejus, qui eam pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuniam pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teret, in ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulationem erat dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cta.</note> and concludes no other thing, but that he is obliged to pay the Penaltie, if he cannot ſhew that the defect came not by his fault, the Contract as to the remainder continuing in its full vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour.</p>
               <p>But when the Debtor hath failed to ſatisfie through the fault of the Creditor, who hath not accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on his part the eſſential Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Contract, then it is out of controverſy that the delay ought not to be imputed unto him,<note place="margin">Argumento L. <hi>23.</hi> ff. de Act. &amp; Obl.</note> and that he is not obliged, neither to the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts, nor the reparation of any Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, although there were a Penalty expreſly ſtipulated in the Contract.</p>
               <p>If we would reduce this buſineſs to the rigours of the Civil Law, we ſhould have a fair field to prove by their own Principles, that all the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay in the payment of the Portion ought not to be imputed to any other
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:101549:90"/>partie but <hi>France</hi> it ſelf, if it be true (as they ſay, and we ſtrongly do deny) that the Renunciation is founded ſolely upon the Portion, that they are Inſeparables, and neceſſarily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending the one upon the other. It follows then by a clear conſequence, that the King neither could nor ought to pay the Portion, untill he had got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten all the Securities which were by the ſame Treatie promiſed to eſtabliſh abſolutely the Renunciation. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they muſt needs agree, that in the IV<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Article of the Contract of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage it is expreſſed in formal terms that the moſt Serene Infanta, after the Act of Renunciation which ſhe ſhall paſs before the Marriage, <hi>ſhall make juſt ſuch another joyntly with the moſt Chriſtian King, as ſoon as ſhe is married with his Majeſtie, which ſhall be Regiſtred and paſſed in the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of</hi> Paris <hi>in the form and with the Clauſes accuſtomed, &amp;c.</hi> This Act not onely hath not appeared, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they make uſe of their own o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion againſt us for one of the
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:101549:90"/>proofs of the Nullity; they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain that ſince the Marriage the Queen was made paſs a ſecret Act which <hi>France</hi> hath not ſeen. But he doth profeſs it more clearly in the 23. page, where, albeit he hath elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where confeſſed the King's Ratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, he doth not ſtick to call it in doubt again in theſe words: <hi>But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all this,</hi> Spain <hi>having made the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanta renounce poſteriourly to her Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage by ſecret Acts, which the</hi> Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards <hi>never durſt let come to light, who is it that can imagine that the moſt Chriſtian King hath validly ratified what he never ſaw, &amp;c?</hi> All this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe contains as many Untruths as words: but we muſt judge them from their own mouth. The moſt Chriſtian King and Queen were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged by a Contract of Marriage (which is a Member of the Peace) to make a new Renunciation in the ſame form as the precedent, as ſoon as the Marriage was accompliſhed, and cauſe it to be Regiſtred in the Parliament of <hi>Paris:</hi> He denies
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:101549:91"/>that this was done, and declares that the King never ſaw it: He maintains that the Portion was neceſſarily and inſeparably tied to the Renuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; they have not ſatisfied this ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary and inſeparable Condition, and for their failing to have ſatisfied, they will needs impugn the Renun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation becauſe of the delay of pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which could not be accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed until that they had given the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curities requiſite for the Renunciati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. We leave it therefore to be judged of, to whom the delay of pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is juſtly to be imputed, which hath been offered divers times, and is offered to them at preſent, if they would but perform the Condition which was promiſed.</p>
               <p>Moreover it is clear in Law, that the payment of a Debt may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by way of compenſation o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="159" facs="tcp:101549:91"/>and <hi>Lewis</hi> the XIII<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. It is certain that in the VI. Article of the Peace his Majeſtie doth abſolutely renounce all his Rights and Pretenſions upon <hi>Alſatia.</hi> This Renunciation is founded upon a Proviſo much more efficacious then that which is contained in the Queen's, which cannot be imputed to any other cauſe then that which is expreſſed in the words following; <hi>By means of which Renunciation his moſt Chriſtian Majeſtie offers to ſatisfie the payment of three millions of livers, which he is bound to pay unto the Arch-Dukes of</hi> Inſpruck.</p>
               <p>This Obligation is contained in the ſame Inſtrument of the Peace, which is all but one Deed with the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Marriage and Renunciation, by which the Portion is promiſed: the one and the other are equally ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging. If the moſt Chriſtian King have been able to diſpenſe with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf without breaking or annulling the Treatie, he cannot pretend that the delay in paying of the Portion is more rigorouſly interpreted. There
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:101549:92"/>was no cauſe on our part which hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred him from ſatisfying this Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation. It ſerves for nothing to ſay that it was not the King to whom he owed this ſumme, ſince it concerned the King that it ſhould be pay'd, that it is he who hath renounced, and that it is he to whom the Promiſe was made in the Treatie; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently it is to him that the moſt Chriſtian King hath contracted the Obligation to ſatisfie the moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene Arch-Duke.</p>
               <p>By theſe Principles the ſecond Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection falls to the ground of it ſelf: Though we ſhould acknowledge that the Infanta hath not been endowed with her Paternal Goods, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation would not ceaſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in its force, as being eſtabliſhed upon more powerful Foundations then that of the Portion; and at the worſt the Queen would not have in this caſe any other right then to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend a Legal Portion.</p>
               <p>But to ſhew that our Right a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds in Reaſons, and that on which
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:101549:92"/>ſide ſoever it be attaqued, they can finde no weakneſs in it; I will briefly demonſtrate that all this diſcourſe which he urges ſo ſtrongly is built upon a falſe Suppoſition.</p>
               <p>The Queen was provided not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly according to the practice accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed to the Princeſſes of <hi>Spain,</hi> but much beyond that, as it appears by the very Deed of Renunciation, in theſe terms: <hi>It is a very competent Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the greateſt which hath yet been given to any Infanta of</hi> Spain, <hi>and this in conſideration of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the moſt Chriſtian King.</hi> Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as I have already ſaid, are not regulated betwixt Kings by the eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the legal Portion, but by a Cuſtome which they eſtabliſh in their Royal Families, which paſſes in ordinary ſtyle, and is ſubject to no Controverſie: elſe to take it in ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour, the Princeſſes of <hi>France</hi> would have been very ill provided with five hundred thouſand Crowns. The eſſential reaſon of this Cuſtome is, becauſe the Princes, who are the
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:101549:93"/>Authours and Interpreters of Laws, conſider the Soul more then the Body, and without ſtaying upon words ought ſolely to take hold of the Reaſon from which they have taken their firſt beginning. Now it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that the Portion given in Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age is inſtituted to help the Husband to undergo the charges of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, and the Legal Portion to keep the Children out of neceſſity, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the death of the Father to ſupply the defect of the Aliment which he did owe them whilſt he lived. All theſe Reaſons do ceaſe amongſt great Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs, whoſe high Fortunes ſhelter them from ordinary Wants, and who ought to propoſe unto themſelves in their Marriages more noble and ſolid Intereſts then that of a petty ſumme of Money. This is the reaſon why they do rarely come to the diſcuſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Goods, the ſupplement of Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Portions, Inventories, and other ſuch ways of redreſs which are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced in favour of private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and are in reſpect of them but
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:101549:93"/>meer Trifles; but rather content themſelves with that which the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of thoſe Courts with which they treat hath eſtabliſhed for this purpoſe, eſteeming it to be much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their Honour to cheapen a Wife, and to make it appear that they ſeek any other thing in her but Greatneſs and Vertue. In fine, the moſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian King did content himſelf, the Queen remained ſatisfied with it. All this did paſs by a Treatie of Peace into the ſtrength of a publick Law; there is no more any remedie.</p>
               <p>I ſay yet farther, that ſhe hath been endowed with her Paternal Goods in two ſorts. The one, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all which was granted unto the moſt Chriſtian King by the Treatie of Peace was done in contemplation of the Marriage, as the Marriage was concluded ſolely in order to the Peace. It is a reciprocal Relation, an inſeparable Connexion, one and the ſelf-ſame Treatie, Cauſe, and End; they cannot poſſibly be divided with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out overthrowing the whole foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:101549:94"/>of the Peace. His Majeſtie hath ſacrificed ſo many fair Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to the Satisfaction and Good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of his Daughter, and the Infanta gave up her Pretenſions for the good of the State, to the Happineſs of this Marriage, and to the Gratitude which ſhe owed to the Bounty of her Father. The Renunciation was reciprocal; that of the moſt Serene Infanta to her Pretenſions was accompanied alſo with the King's to ſo many rich Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, and even to the Right which he had to <hi>Alſatia.</hi> Nor can it be preſumed with any apparence of Reaſon, that he would have deveſted himſelf with ſuch facility of ſo great an Eſtate, if he had not been invited thereunto by the Love of his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and the deſire to ſee her reign happily, by heaping Benefits and Satisfactions upon the King her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band. And if there remained any doubt or ambiguitie as to this, the preſumption is in favour of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>Before I do enter into an exact

<pb n="166" facs="tcp:101549:95"/>before any other Condition was treated of. This is evident, becauſe the Marriage could not be treated of until the Obſtacle was removed: from whence this conſequence is drawn, That whatſoever the King endowed the Infanta with by way of Portion was purely out of his own Stock.</p>
               <p>However, if it behaved us to come to a Citizen-like Account, one might deduct with Juſtice from the Mater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Goods all that was expended for her Maintenance ever ſince the death of her Mother, being certain that whenever the Maternal Goods do exceed the value of the Portion, the Father is really obliged to ſupply it out of his own: but he may deduct the Aliments, which he is not obliged to give when the Daughter is endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with her own proper Goods.<note place="margin">

The King did inherit from Prince <hi>Balthaſar:</hi> his Son all his Maternal Goods, which, according to
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:101549:95"/>the Law of <hi>Spain,</hi> ought to return to the Father. The Law which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prives the Fathers and Mothers of this Succeſſion in caſe of Second Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages is reproved by the Canons; it never had other cauſe or reaſon, then to put a bridle upon Marriages which are made out of Covetouſneſs to the prejudice of the Children of the Firſt Bed. But the Second Marriage of the deceaſed King was an inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Neceſſitie of State, the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal deſire of the People, and a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe Obligation which he owed unto his Subjects and his Houſe. Monarchs ſhould act by Principles quite diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from thoſe of the vulgar; and if one would tie them in publick Acts to the ordinary Laws, all their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct would be diſordered, by ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring of them uncapable to provide freely for the publick Neceſſities. Poſſibly the Jewels were not deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered <hi>in ſpecie</hi> to the moſt Serene In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanta; but threefold more at the leaſt hath been given her. It is not the cuſtome of Kings to take Acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:101549:96"/>nor to keep Regiſters of all that they beſtow upon their Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; they pour out upon them with full hands, without account and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out meaſure: they are not accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but to Treaties depending upon ſincere faith, juſtly ſcorning thoſe little Formalities which are not eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed for them.</p>
               <p>But though all this were not ſo, is it a matter which merits all this ſtirre, that all <hi>Europe</hi> ſhould be troubled, and a War raiſed again, which hath coſt ſo much bloud, ſo many tears and Deſolations to Chriſtendome?

               <p>It would require great Volumes
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:101549:97"/>to make appear by parcells the Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities it matter of Fact, the Allegati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons out of ſeaſon, the captious So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſms, and the continual Cavills which are packed up into this Work: It is a buſineſs of more time and lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure then the trouble in which they have put us doth allow. I think I have ſaid enough upon this Subject to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince all reaſonable underſtandings: and to make an end of confounding our Enemies, I will content my ſelf by concluding with this Argument: That if they will reduce, againſt all manner of Reaſon, the publick Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties made between Kings to the Forms and Subtilties of litigious Pleading, they ought to follow the ſame Rules in their Proceeding; if they do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to make a Proceſs of it, they ſhould not make it a War. Never yet was it ſeen that Legal Portions or Reliefs were pretended to with a Dagger at the throat, nor Contracts reſcinded by ſtroke of Sword, nor the firſt Citations made by forty thouſand men. Either let us decide this matter
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:101549:98"/>by publick Right, and by the Faith of a ſolemn Treatie made betwixt Crown and Crown; or if they have a mind to bring it to the formalities of the Barr, let us not ſtray from its ſtyle, which doth not permit Violence to uſurp upon Juſtice: and that which the Kings of <hi>France</hi> do not practiſe towards their own Subjects when there is any Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them to be decided by the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Laws, they ought not to attempt it againſt a Monarch who doth not hold of them, and who is ready to refer his Cauſe to the Judgement of all the Princes of <hi>Europe.</hi> But they are far from this thought, they'l have no other Arbiter but Arms; and if in appearance they do ſometimes call for the aſſiſtance of Juſtice, it is but to make it ſerve as an inſtrument of their Violence: They make uſe of her own Laws againſt her ſelf; they make her raiſe Difficulties, but will not ſuffer her to reſolve them; they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent ſhe plead, but not that ſhe decide; and at the ſame time when they make
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:101549:98"/>her enter into Combat, they tie her hands, they ſhut up all the approches to her, they will not permit her to pronounce, and do ſo pervert the whole order of things, that to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh a Chimerical Right, they make it a private Buſineſs, and that they may put it in Execution, they make of it a matter of State.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>That the Succeſſion of the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty of the Dutchie of <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant,</hi> and other Provinces ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified in theſe Libells, ought not to be regulated by particular Cuſtoms.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THE eſſential Sovereignty is in God, as in its ſource; thoſe which we do reverence here below are Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volets that flow from thence: It de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcends from Heaven to Earth, and
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:101549:99"/>ſpreads it ſelf in divers faſhions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Creatures, according to the Subordination which is neceſſary for the Government of the World. It communicates it ſelf in the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way principally and immediately to Monarchs, to Princes, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times unto the whole Body of the People, which remits it voluntarily to thoſe Magiſtrates whom they chuſe, and reduces it into the form of Government which ſeems to be fitteſt for their happineſs. Some of theſe are abſolute, and hold it of God ſolelie; others are Sovereigns in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of their Subjects, but with ſome tie of Dependencie upon a Superiour Power: and as thoſe do derive im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately from the Infinite Power above; ſo theſe do proceed gradually through the Chanel of that Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty to which they are ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate; this is its Rule and origine, having no other Power nor Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on then that which is conveyed unto it through this Organ, becauſe being nothing of it ſelf, but according to the
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:101549:99"/>will of the Inſtituters, it can exerciſe no other Right then what it hath ſo received from it. If Sovereignties were regulated by Local Cuſtoms, it would be as monſtrous a thing as if Kings would preſcribe limits to the Providence of God, or as to ſee Streams run back upon their Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain: The Order of the World, which ſubſiſts onely by theſe degrees of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendencie of the leaſt upon the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, muſt be abſolutely overthrown: the Servants would become Maſters, the Sovereigns ſhould be Subjects, and the hereditary Sovereignties be in the ſame condition with Villages and Farms. The Eternal Law, which is the very Wiſedom of God, is the rule of all Laws: and as that is proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Idea of the Law of Sovereigns, ſo that of Sovereigns is the Model of particular ones, which take from it all their ſtrength and vigour. If an Equal cannot have any command over his Equal, it would be much more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable that the Inferiour ſhould have it over him whom he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:101549:100"/>for his Maſter, and that the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Cuſtoms eſtabliſhed between Subjects ſhould preſcribe unto their Sovereigns the order of their Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. All that there is of Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Power in ſubaltern Fiefs, is found in a more excellent manner in the commanding Fief: But all that there is of Servitude, Dependencie and Subjection in them, regards not the Sovereignty, and cannot reflect upon it from beneath upwards; theſe are Reſtrictions and Limitations which cannot proceed but from a more elevated Power. So that the Sovereign Fiefs which hold of a higher Juriſdiction can receive no limits to their Authority but from the direct Lord, who is alſo to regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late himſelf therein according to the extent of that Power which he hath over them, and according to their firſt Inſtitution; for he may not impoſe new burthens upon them farther then thoſe upon which from the beginning they did agree in the regulating of the Fief.</p>
               <pb n="177" facs="tcp:101549:100"/>
               <p>To diſcourſe ſolidly of this matter, two things muſt be carefully exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and taken from their true founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>The one is the nature and the firſt Origine of the Dutchie of <hi>Brabant,</hi> and of the other Provinces to which <hi>France</hi> doth pretend: the other is the Origine, the quality, the end, and the extent of the Local Cuſtom, which hath introduced the Right of Devolution.</p>
               <p>As to the firſt, it is out of contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie that a part of the Dutchie of <hi>Brabant,</hi> though Sovereign in it ſelf, doth in ſome ſort hold of the Empire; I ſay, in ſome ſort, becauſe as well by its own nature, as by its Privileges, it is exempt from many Subjections which are proper to other Imperial Fiefs, though Sovereigns and Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. This then muſt be conſidered in two manners; the one in the Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence which it hath of the Empire, and the other in the Sovereignty which it hath over its Subjects. Tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the firſt, it cannot extend be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:101549:101"/>the terms which are expreſsly preſcribed by the Inveſtiture. So that it cannot receive from any thing elſe any other reſtriction of its Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, unleſs it doth voluntarily impoſe it upon it ſelf. And for the ſecond, it belongs to it to eſtabliſh Laws, and communicates its Power to its Inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours as much as ſhall be thought good, and reſtrains it within juſt limits.</p>
               <p>Moreover, although theſe be Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignties in themſelves, they muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo be look'd upon as chained together by an undiſſolvible tie, and as annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Body of the Monarchy of which they are the Members and the Parts.</p>
               <p>If we conſider them in themſelves, we ſhall find that in their Succeſſions the Males ought to be preferred to the Females; and that this Order hath been ſo regularly obſerved in all times, that not ſo much as one exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple can be ſhewn where the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters have ſucceeded to the excluſion of the Males of the ſame Line; as may be ſeen in the Genealogical Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:101549:101"/>of the Trophies of the Dutchie of <hi>Brabant,</hi> written by <hi>Chriſtopher But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens.</hi> I ſay more, that the primitive Inſtitution of the particular Fiefs of <hi>Brabant</hi> was made in favour of the Males, and that the Right of Devoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was afterwards introduced among them for particular Ends; ſo that if the Devolution doth hinder them from Alienating, it is but an Obſtacle introduced by private perſons, which hath inſenſibly gotten the force of a Cuſtome among them; and being onely a particular Right, it can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tie the Prince nor the Sovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, becauſe it comes but from a ſimple Cuſtome and Conſent of the Subjects, who have no Juriſdiction over the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour Power. So that to judge of the Right of Succeſſion of the Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Fief, one muſt look into the firſt Original thereof, and into its proper nature independently of all that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour to it.</p>
               <p>If we conſider the principal End of this ordinary Cuſtome, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrs the Males before the Females
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:101549:102"/>even in the Succeſſion of particular Fiefs, we ſhall find that it is for the conſervation of Noble Families, for fear their Eſtates ſhould paſs to and be confounded in ſome other Houſe, to the prejudice of them who are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to uphold the Splendour, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Name, and perpetuate the Line of them. Though this benefit in ſome ſort do redound to the good of the State, it is but by an indirect reflexion, and by the relation of the private to the publick; and 'tis for this that it may be derogated from in conſideration of another private good, if it be eſteemed to be equal or of greater importance then the other. But the conſervation of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignties is a good which directly concerns the State, againſt which no private Reaſon can prevail; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe what Diſorder would it be in the World, if we did ſee Sovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties liable to the change of Maſters every moment, and paſs under ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Dominion? How many cauſes of War and Revolutions would ariſe
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:101549:102"/>from ſuch a ſtrange Conſtitution, which could not but offend all Laws and good Politie? How unworthy a ſpectacle muſt this be and what an heart-breaking to faithfull Subjects, to ſee their Princes and all their Line reduced to povertie, whilſt a Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhould elevate to their Throne ſome Stranger-Prince? If theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences be compared with the particular good which ariſes from the Devolution, it will be found that the one is but an Atome in compariſon of the other; and that there is no kind of appearance that the very People, though it had been in their power, would ever have been ſuch enemies to themſelves, as to have expoſed themſelves to all theſe dangers, by ſubjecting their Prince to their Cuſtome, and taken pleaſure to live under a Dominion ſuſpended in the Air, and expoſed to all Winds. On the contrary, Sovereigns in one thing ſeem to be in a worſe condition then private perſons; becauſe in the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of States which are well go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:101549:103"/>they cannot alienate any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of their Dominions, they are in ſome kind Slaves to the Publick good, they cannot doe advantage to a youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Brother to the prejudice of the Elder, and are ordinarily ſo tied to the regular order of Succeſſion, which preferrs the Males and the Eldeſt, that they cannot follow the motions of their Affection to the prejudice of this Rule, which the Safety of the State renders not to be diſpenſed with: how then can it be overthrown and deſtroyed by a local Cuſtome, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted to an End which cannot be put in the balance with the Utilitic which proceeds from this publick Law? In effect, If we look upon the order of the Succeſſions of the Dukes of <hi>Brabant,</hi> and of the Princes of the other Provinces in the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> it will be found that they have alwaies deſcended from Father to Son, as long as that could be had, and that in no caſe they have been divided nor ſhared among many Children, though there have been often ſundry Males
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:101549:103"/>of the ſame Bed.<note place="margin">Butkens, <hi>pag.</hi> 107, 113, 133, 204, 270, 232, &amp;c.</note> As is ſeen in <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey</hi> the Firſt, who left two Sons of his firſt Marriage, <hi>Godfrey</hi> and <hi>Henry; Godfrey</hi> his Son ſucceeded ſinglie to the Dutchie: and of three Sons which he had, <hi>Godfrey</hi> the Elder, ſty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Third, ſucceeded alone: he had two Sons by his firſt Wife, <hi>Henry</hi> and <hi>Albert;</hi> the Elder onely ſuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the Dutchy, as <hi>Henry</hi> the Third had done; and the ſame throughout the whole Succeſſion. From whence I draw two Conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: One, That the Sovereign Fief is by its nature indiviſible; which ſhews that the principal end is to conſerve it entire in the Family, which were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſefull, if it muſt deſcend to the Daughters of the Firſt Bed, to the excluſion of the Males; for in this caſe it would import very little that it were diſmembred, and it would be more juſt and more covenient to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide it, at leaſt among the Children of the ſame Bed. The other is, That by this Indiviſibilitie it is different from particular Fiefs, which, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:101549:104"/>to the Feodal Cuſtoms, are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table beyond the Forreſt at the choice of the Eldeſt; and on this ſide, though there were but one Fief, the Eldeſt hath but two Thirds, and the reſt belongs to the Brothers, excepting to the Eldeſt the Caſtle, and a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon's flight: which being unpracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable in a Sovereign Fief,<note place="margin">Chap. 21. of the Feo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms of <hi>Brabant.</hi>
                  </note> 'tis evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that there is a manifeſt difference, and that the one hath for its end onely the particular good of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, and the other the good of the State, which chiefly conſiſts in keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Sovereignty as long as is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible in the ſame Line, that it may not be expoſed to continual Changes. So that being of a different nature, we cannot draw any conſequence from the Fief to the Crown, nor ſubject the Lording Fief to the Local Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms, which be of another nature and for other ends. This difference is the more remarkable, by reaſon that the ſubſervient Fiefs which Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces do poſſeſs are of another nature, and ſubject to other Laws then the
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:101549:104"/>Sovereigntie, and do not depend of one and the ſame Juriſdiction; as is to be ſeen in <hi>Butkens,</hi> in the Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the year 1222. And it is out of doubt that theſe may be divided, and the other not, as is clear by the XXI. Article it ſelf, which I cited before: and even the Cuſtoms of <hi>Lovain</hi> were decreed with this Clauſe; <hi>Without prejudice to the Rights and the Superiorities of the King.</hi> Which clearly demonſtrates, that in the toleration or approbation of theſe particular Cuſtoms, the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigns never meant to ſubject their Sovereignties; and that the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence which they draw from the one to the other cannot be of vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie betwixt two ſuch diſproporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate things. In the Cuſtoms of <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant</hi> and the other Provinces, which the King hath approved, this Reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is ordinarily found, <hi>Without prejudice to our Rights and Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</hi> A notable difference is yet to be obſerved here, which is, that pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate perſons may derogate and do
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:101549:105"/>daily derogate from the Devolution by their Treaties of Marriage, or by Teſtaments, to preſerve the free diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of their Goods to themſelves, and to hinder the Daughters of the Firſt Bed from coming to exclude the Sons of the Second; which Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces have never practiſed, though much more concerned in conſerving their Succeſſions in the Maſculine Line, and would not have failed to uſe thoſe Precautions as well as pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate perſons do againſt this Cuſtome, had they believed that they were ſubject unto it as others are.</p>
               <p>We ſhall be yet more confirmed in this opinion, if we conſider that, far from having a minde to diſmember any of thoſe Provinces by virtue of ſuch a Cuſtome, they united them together by an inſeparable Concate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, by a Sanction eſtabliſhed by the Supreme Authority, and received by the univerſal Conſent of all the People: ſo that it hath paſſed ever ſince that time, and is ſtill held at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, to be a Fundamental Law. I
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:101549:105"/>will ſatiſfie in the following part of this Article ſome light Scruples which the Author of this Writing forms thereupon: In this place it ſhall ſuffice me to deduce from it an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Argument, that the intention both of the Sovereign and the People hath been much oppoſite to that of ſubjecting them to Cuſtoms, which would expoſe them upon all moments to the danger of being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred and diſtracted into other Families.</p>
               <p>In fine, they are Members of the Monarchie of <hi>Spain;</hi> and though they do live under their own Laws and particular Cuſtoms, and enjoy peaceably their own Privileges; they are notwithſtanding Members of it, and depend upon it as Parts of the Whole: ſo that if there were no Law nor Cuſtome eſtabliſhed for the Succeſſion of their Sovereignties, it would be much more juſt and conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient to regulate it by the Law of the principal Kingdom whereunto they are Acceſſories,<note place="margin">The Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue, <hi>pag.</hi> 39.</note> then by a Local
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:101549:106"/>Cuſtome, which hath no place but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Subjects: and if this ſame Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour doth avow, that where there is no Law eſtabliſhed for the Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of a Sovereign Fief, it may be regulated by the Laws of the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring States; we ought here with a far juſter title to conform our ſelves to the order and practice of other Kingdomes to which they are united, and under the ſupport and the protection of which they are maintained.</p>
               <p>Here may be obſerved (in paſſing) the incompatibilitie which we meet with in the Diſcourſe of this Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: He will have it that the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Succeſſion of theſe Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces is ſo to be ſubject to the Local Cuſtome of the Devolution, that it can no ways be diſpenſed with, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the good of the State, nor by the Renunciation of her to whom the Right is devolved, making a ſimple Cuſtome of private perſons paſs for a Fundamental Law of the State: but by the ſame Diſcourſe it
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:101549:106"/>evidently follows, that theſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces neither can, nor ought ever to fall under the Dominion of <hi>France,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Salique</hi> Law, by virtue whereof they do pretend that all their new Acquiſitions muſt be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the ſame Rule to which the ancient Dominions are ſubject, would pull up by the root this very Devolution, which at preſent they will have to be unalterable, and alſo totally exclude Women from the Right of Succeſſion, though they were the ſole Heirs: ſo that they will eſtabliſh this particular Right in our Provinces, but onely to deſtroy it by Incorporating them inſtantly into their Kingdom. They make uſe of it to acquire them, and will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently overthrow it to conſerve them; and do erect this Right in their own favour, but onely to annihilate it afterwards to our dammage. This is an effect of their Nimbleneſs, which knows how to apply wittily all the Laws to their own uſe, that they may make them ſerve as Inſtruments to their Ambition.</p>
               <pb n="190" facs="tcp:101549:107"/>
               <p>It remains now at preſent that we look into the nature and qualitie of this Local Cuſtome, which it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain is not of the firſt origine of Fiefs, ſince the diſpoſition of them in favour of Males is directly oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed thereunto.</p>
               <p>It is yet more certain that it doth not flow from the Sovereign, becauſe he himſelf in many places hath not approved of it, and that the ſame Approbation which the People have required of him is a ſure mark that it hath taken its beginning elſewhere then from him; nor can it be ſaid that it hath been formed upon the model of Sovereign Succeſſion, which of its own nature was purely reſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Males, and hath not been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to Females, but by a privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege limited onely to the deficiencie of Males. It is then to be concluded, that it hath inſenſibly ſlipt in by a Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome which ſome particular Conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences have introduced. Neither is it univerſal, nor every where uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, even in <hi>Brabant:</hi> many Diſtricts
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:101549:107"/>are totally exempted from it, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have received it with divers Limitations. The City of <hi>Bruxells,</hi> that of <hi>Antwerp,</hi> with the Country of <hi>Ryen,</hi> the Territorie of <hi>Turnhout, Hoochſtraten</hi> with its Diſtrict, a part of the Countrey beyond the River of <hi>Maeſe,</hi> and the whole Quarter of <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velle,</hi> are not ſubject to the Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution. And this proceeds from no other cauſe, but that they have not received this Cuſtome; which in it ſelf is of ſuch a nature, that it is of no force but in thoſe places where it is approved of by the Conſent of the People. How then can any extend to the Sovereigntie, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Conſent of the Prince, a Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome which doth not oblige the Subjects but in ſo farre as they have expreſly deſired? How can a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick and Fundamental Law be made of a Cuſtome which is not univerſal, nor eſtabliſhed by the Sovereign, and which is tied to the particular circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of Goods and Places? And if the Authours of the Dialogue and
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:101549:108"/>the Treatiſe of the Queen's Rights do avow <hi>the Devolution to be a kind of Penaltie,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Fol.</hi> 50.</note> how can it be conceived that the Prince ſhould be ſubject there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto? and that the Fiefs ſubſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent can impoſe by the example of their Cuſtom a Servitude on the Crown? Never in good Logick can the Argument conclude <hi>de mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nori ad majus,</hi> unleſs it be in matters of Favour.</p>
               <p>This Cuſtome then cannot paſs for a Law, becauſe it doth not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the expreſs Ordinance of the Prince, but onely from the tacite Conſent of the Subjects, who had no other object therein but their proper Intereſts. The Prince con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed nothing towards it but a ſimple Toleration, and, far from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to oblige his own Sovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to it, he hath not abſolutely appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of it, nor generally in all places. The Feodal Cuſtoms of <hi>Brabant,</hi> be it either for ſuch Fiefs as are on this ſide the Forreſt, or them which are beyond it, and which depend
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:101549:108"/>upon the Feodal Court of <hi>Lothier</hi> or of <hi>Genap,</hi> were never approved nor decreed, although they were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to the Governour to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: and in ſome others which are approved, the Prince, as I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, doth expreſly except <hi>his Rights and Preeminences,</hi> reſerving to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the power <hi>to change, alter, and innovate them as he thinks fit;</hi> which he could not doe without the conſent of the States, if it were a Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Law which did tie up his proper Sovereigntie. And though by way of ſuppoſition we ſhould acknowledg that this Cuſtome extends it ſelf to the Sovereigntie; it were ridiculous to pretend that he may not abrogate it in his Familie, ſince he hath the right both to change and innovate it in thoſe of his Subjects.</p>
               <p>But if it were granted to them that ſuch like Cuſtoms do reach un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Sovereignties, they would give us a juſt Right to pretend unto <hi>Bretanny</hi> and the Dutchie of <hi>Burgundie,</hi> where Women ought to be admitted to the
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:101549:109"/>Succeſſion of Fiefs, not onely by the Cuſtome of the people, but expreſly alſo by the Law of the State, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the Sovereigntie it ſelf: to which purpoſe it will avail nothing to alledge the <hi>Salique</hi> Law, which is Apocryphal among the moſt learned, and which at moſt cannot tranſcend the limits of the ancient Domains of <hi>France,</hi> nor can change but by unjuſt Violence the nature of the Provinces which they do annex to their Crown; but if that might be done by virtue of the <hi>Salique</hi> Law, why ſhould it not be lawful for our King to impoſe on thoſe Provinces which he hath acquired the ſame Law which he doth practiſe in <hi>Spain?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having manifeſtly proved by ſo palpable Reaſons that the Local Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms as well of <hi>Brabant,</hi> as of the other Provinces pretended to, cannot be the Rule of Sovereigntie; it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains that we take notice by what other legal ways they may be regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated: and this cannot be by any but onely the following.</p>
               <pb n="195" facs="tcp:101549:109"/>
               <list>
                  <item>1. By the nature of the ſaid So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Fiefs, and their firſt Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution.</item>
                  <item>2. By the ordinary Cuſtome of the Sovereign Fiefs of the Empire, of which ſome of theſe Provinces do hold.</item>
                  <item>3. By the End for which they are eſtabliſhed, and by the Reaſon of State, and the publick Intereſt.</item>
                  <item>4. By the ancient and continual Practice in the like Succeſſions.</item>
               </list>
               <p>As to the firſt, it is undoubted that the Sovereign Fief of <hi>Brabant</hi> in its firſt beginning, and by the Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Emperours, was onely reſtricted to the Males, to the entire excluſion of the Females; and that ſince, by the conceſſion of the ſame Emperours, it was extended unto Daughters, but onely in default of Heirs-male, as it is expreſly recorded in the Imperial Conſtitution.</p>
               <p>But that of the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the V<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, made in the year 1549,<note place="margin">Corſt. Phil. Rom. Reg. An. <hi>1204.</hi>
                  </note> doth entirely ſtop the current of all the Difficulties that could be formed on
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:101549:110"/>this Subject, by the indiviſible Union which he eſtabliſhed among all the Provinces of the <hi>Low-Countreys.</hi> It is here where the Authours of theſe Libells loſe the Card of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs, and blunt the points of their darts, endeavouring all in vain to ſhoot againſt this Rock. This Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution is both of the Emperour and of the proprietarie Prince; 'tis univerſal, and comprehends all the Provinces; 'tis ſolemn and authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, by the general Conſent of all the Eſtates, and the ſubſcription of all the Grandees, of the principal Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, and the moſt illuſtrious No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility; it is eſtabliſhed, becauſe it was not onely received, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo earneſtly ſolicited by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wiſhes of the whole People: 'tis a publick Law, which proceeds from the Sovereign Authority, it concerns the Crown immediately, it is founded upon the publick Utility, and hath for its chief End the Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of all theſe Provinces under one and the ſame Lord: The terms
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:101549:110"/>are clear: <hi>Deſiring above all things to provide for the Good, Quiet and Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity of our Countreys on this ſide, and to keep them together in one body, and that they may be inſeparably poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by one Prince alone.</hi> Behold a publick, neceſſary, and inviolable Cauſe, which directly regards the Principalities. But, on the contrary, the Cuſtome of the Devolution is conceived in terms that cannot be otherwiſe applied then to private ones; <hi>If either a Man or a Woman have Children, &amp;c.</hi> Were the Prince comprehended, it would have been expreſſed in words of more reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and clearer: but the notice of the Cuſtome expreſly ſaith, that it comprehends nothing but the Fiefs which hold of the Duke of <hi>Brabant,</hi> and (as the Writer himſelf confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth) it is made in favour of the Firſt Marriage, and out of the hatred to Second Beds, which ought rather to be favoured then diſcountenanced in the perſon of Sovereigns, chiefly when they are deſtitute of Heirs-male.
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:101549:111"/>But let us go on farther to the terms of the concluſion of this ſame Sanction: <hi>We do enact and decree, that in all our ſaid Countreys Repreſentation ſhall have place in what touches the Succeſſion either of Prince or Princeſſes being capable to ſucceed.</hi> All this Clauſe muſt neceſſarily be referred to the former, as built upon this foundation, <hi>To conſerve theſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces in one Maſs together, &amp;c.</hi> Both the one and the other do totally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the Devolution, if it be to be underſtood in that form which theſe Writers do pretend. Moreover, it is evident that this Union of Eſtates cannot conſiſt with the Devolution, becauſe that this Cuſtome is not ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally eſtabliſhed in all the Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which are comprehended in this Union, whereby it might fall out that the Daughters of the Firſt Bed ſhould carry away a part of them by the Devolution, and the Males of the Second Marriage by the Law of the Countrey ſhould poſſeſs the other; and by this means the order and the
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:101549:111"/>end of the Sanction ſhould be abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely overthrown.</p>
               <p>I do profeſs that, reflecting upon all theſe things, I find my ſelf ſeiſed with prodigious aſtoniſhment, to ſee that theſe Writers do not bluſh at the libertie which they have given to their pens, in contradicting of Truths ſo manifeſt and ſo generally receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and that they are ſo effronted as to dare vent unto their own King and to the eyes of all <hi>Europe</hi> theſe extravagant Propoſitions:<note place="margin">Dialogue, <hi>pag.</hi> 46.</note> 
                  <hi>That there is nothing more contrary to Hiſtory, nor to the deſires of all the Provinces,</hi> then this Sanction which unites all thoſe Provinces together; <hi>That this Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour had truly thoughts of doing of it, but that he found ſo open a Repugnancie againſt it, and ſo invincible a one in the inclinations of the Countrey, &amp;c. That he quitted it very ſoon, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nothing can be more falſely al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged: This Sanction was received, and is to be ſeen ſtill Regiſtred in all the Chambers of Accounts in the <hi>Low-Countreys.</hi> But the Authour takes
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:101549:112"/>up a miſtake, or elſe will impoſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Readers who will rely upon his faith; he confoundeth another Deſign of <hi>Charles</hi> the V<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, from whence he deſiſted, with this of the Pragmatick Sanction, which he finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without contradiction. It is true that this Prince had ſome thoughts of erecting all theſe Provinces into a Kingdome, to the ſame Cuſtome and Politie; but having met with great difficulties about the diverſity of Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms, Privileges, Seals, and Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, he held it not fit to put it in execution: but as to the Union con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Pragmatick Sanction, the diverſity of Laws not extending it ſelf to the Sovereigntie could not hinder the Union, ſeeing that in <hi>France</hi> it ſelf, where all the Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are inſeparably united to the Crown, they do notwithſtanding live under their particular Laws, which in many places are very diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent; and when we ſay they are uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, we do not therefore pretend that they are reduced into one Province,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:101549:112"/>but that they compoſe all together one aggregate of many Bodies, which cannot be disjoyned. So that 'tis properly to diſtribute Gape-ſeed, and amuſe all <hi>Europe</hi> with the tricks of Jugglers, in alledging for the proof of the contrary, that the King <hi>in his qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities uſes all the Titles of theſe Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſeverally;</hi> as if by having united them he had loſt thoſe Titles, and were leſs Count of <hi>Hainault</hi> for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving rendred it inſeparable from the Dutchie of <hi>Brabant.</hi> If the Diviſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity could be inferred from the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the Titles, it is clear that how ſuccinct ſoever thoſe of the moſt Chriſtian Kings be, it might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded by the ſame reaſon, that that part of <hi>Navarre</hi> which they do poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs might be ſeparated from <hi>France,</hi> whereunto notwithſtanding they will never condeſcend. The paſſage of <hi>Grotius</hi> which he alledges, but doth not quote, is not to the purpoſe, and toucheth not the fact in queſtion, but onely the Deſign of <hi>Charles</hi> the V<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, which preſently I have related. <hi>He
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:101549:113"/>ſpeaks of the change of the ſtate of the Government of the Countrie,</hi> and not of the Union and Indiviſibility of the Provinces, which may be eſtabliſhed among them without any alteration in the Form of their Government, and without changing any thing of the particular Cuſtoms, unleſs it be in what they have of inconſiſtent with this Union.</p>
               <p>It is with the ſame confidence that he preſumes to ſay, that this <hi>Pragma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick doth not contain in its diſpoſitive one word of this <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion.</hi> And what would then the firſt Clauſe which I cited operate, which is not onely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitive, but the ground of all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Diſpoſitions which are contained in the ſame Law? It is the Cauſe and the End of it; and the ſole Reaſon why the Emperour eſtabliſhed the Repreſentation is, to <hi>preſerve the Countries in one Maſs, and that they be inſeparably poſſeſſed by one Prince alone.</hi> This Repreſentation, in which he labours to lodge ſolely all the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitive, is but a purſuit and a means
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:101549:113"/>to attain to the principal End which he hath propoſed to himſelf of the Indiviſibility: but by the diſcourſe of this Authour, the Cauſe would be of leſs ſtrength then its Effect, the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſory would have the place of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitive, and the Principal ſerve one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as a ſimple Narration.</p>
               <p>This Truth is confirmed by the Conſtitution of <hi>Charles, An.</hi> 1549. whereby though he doth confirm the Succeſſion of the Daughters for want of Heirs-male, he ſuppoſes notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding for the ground of the Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Nos per Pragmaticam Sanctionem ſuper Jure Succeſſionis univerſalis ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum Provinciarum Inferioris</hi> Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niae <hi>patrimoniali ac haereditario Jure ad nos pertinentium providere velle, quòd ſcilicet eaedom Provinciae noſtrae in una Maſſa deinceps beneficio Reprae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentationis generaliter in Succeſſione Principis locum recipientis ſerventur, nec ampliùs unquam ab invicem ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentur.</hi> And to ſhew that it was at the deſire of the People, he adds, <hi>Id quad jam antea à Statibus</hi> Geldriae
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:101549:114"/>
                  <hi>petitum.</hi> Whereby two things are clearly ſeen: The one, That the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation was not introduced into this Sanction, but as a means for at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to the principal End of the Indiviſibilitie: the other, That when he admitted the Daughters in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of Heirs-male, he would yet pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve in them the ſame Indiviſibilitie, and that they might not be divided even among many Daughters, as is certain by the words following: <hi>Nè ſcilicet à Ducatu noſtro</hi> Brabantiae <hi>&amp; Comitatu</hi> Hollandiae <hi>(in quibus Foemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nae ex antiqua conſuetudine ſuccede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt) diſtraherentur.</hi> And in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitive Clauſe wherein he confirms the Succeſſion of Women he doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly adde this Reſtriction; <hi>non ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantibus Maſculis haeredibus ſuccede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re poſſint.</hi> Whereby it is ſeen that in no caſe they can ſucceed, ſo long as there are any Heirs-male.</p>
               <p>I ſhould never have done, if I would ſtop at each of their Cavills: The Declaration which he doth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of <hi>Philip</hi> the Second is one,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:101549:114"/>but ſo ill fitted to the purpoſe, that it makes me pitty them. He ſaith that in the Confirmation which he made of the Privileges of <hi>Brabant,</hi> he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, that <hi>the onely Eſtates that ſhould be united for perpetuity with</hi> Brabant <hi>were</hi> Limbourg, Antwerp, <hi>and thoſe beyond the</hi> Maeſe. Here by the way it is to be obſerved that <hi>Limbourg</hi> was never united to <hi>Brabant,</hi> as <hi>Stockmans</hi> doth note, fol. 174. But what Union ſoever there might be, ſhould they be ſo ill Logicians as to inferr from thence, that the other Provinces are not indiviſibly united with <hi>Brabant?</hi> Should it be poſſible that he ſhould hope to throw duſt in our eyes with this petty Equivocation, by the which he confounds and improperly applies the word Union? <hi>Antwerp,</hi> as he ſays, was united to <hi>Brabant</hi> as to a principal Body, to enjoy with it the ſame Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges and Seals, and to make up to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether the Juriſdiction of one Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel: We never pretended that by the Sanction of <hi>Charles</hi> the V<hi rend="sup">th</hi> the other Provinces were united after the ſame
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:101549:115"/>manner, nor that they ought to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate with them in their Privileges. See, I beſeech you, what force this Argument hath: <hi>Antwerp</hi> alone and <hi>Limbourg</hi> were united to the Dutchie of <hi>Brabant,</hi> to enjoy the ſame Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges; therefore the Sanction of <hi>Charles</hi> the V<hi rend="sup">th</hi> never intended that <hi>the other Provinces and</hi> Brabant <hi>it ſelf ſhould be preſerved in a Maſs, to be inſeparably poſſeſſed by one Prince alone. Antwerp</hi> and <hi>Limbourg</hi> onely ſhall enjoy the particular Privileges of <hi>Brabant;</hi> therefore all the other Provinces ſhall be untied from all Union, and may paſs under different Maſters. <hi>Philip the Second prohibited the Infanta</hi> Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella <hi>to divide the Provinces;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were not united. On the contrary, this very Prohibition muſt ſuppoſe that they were united, ſince nothing can be divided but what is united.

And if the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of this Authour could take place, all the Commandments of God and of Kings might be deſtroyed: When a Father commands his Child not to be a Murtherer, it might in the ſame manner be inferred that God hath not forbidden Murther; when a King exhorts his Subjects to Fidelitie, a conſequence might be drawn from thence, that they are not obliged to Fidelity by natural Duty and by their Oath; then which nothing can be more irrational.</p>

               <p>In fine, they ſtumble at every ſtep, and it would require an <hi>Herculean</hi> pains to help them up again every time that they fall. It ſeems that they have had no other care, but to make
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:101549:116"/>up a heap of Arguments, without diſcretion and without choice, to dazle rather then to perſuade, and to obtain by their number that which they can never hope for from the ſtrength of their Reaſons.</p>
               <p>The Authour of the Rights of the Queen follows the ſame track, and loſes himſelf in his own Labyrinth, who is not aſhamed to utter this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition; That <hi>if the Prince be anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enter then the Cuſtome,</hi>

                  <hi>nothing can be more glorious for him then to ſubmit himſelf unto it, &amp;c. ſince it is certain that, in this caſe, the Cuſtome is but an Emanation of the particular practice of the Sovereign Familie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here are as many Errours as words. It is certain that moſt of the Cuſtoms take their beginning from the deſire of the People, and from their private advantage; they do frame to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves their own Cuſtome, of which afterwards they deſire the Prince's Approbation, who grants or refuſes it as he thinks good: but by appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it he doth not ſubject himſelf to
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:101549:117"/>it. Nor is it leſs evident that divers Cuſtoms are convenient for the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which would be moſt prejudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al to Sovereign Families; as in effect that of the Devolution would be. It is certain likewiſe that <hi>if the Prince be ancienter then the Cuſtome,</hi> he hath already the Right and the Form of his Succeſſion regulated before the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, and this Regulation, being a Sovereign Law, can never be altered by a particular and inferiour Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution. He doth profeſs in another place,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 166.</note> that the Sovereignties <hi>have particular attributes which do diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh them from other Goods.</hi> And in what ought they to be more diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed then in that which regards the Succeſſion, which imports more to the ſubſiſtence of Sovereignties then any other thing? He himſelf doth acknowledge it in the ſame page, <hi>as their being Independents;</hi> and yet notwithſtanding he will make them to depend upon the Cuſtome: <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enables;</hi> yet he will ſubject them to a Right which at every moment
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:101549:117"/>would be the occaſion of their Alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation: and <hi>Indiviſibles;</hi> yet he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies that the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the V<hi rend="sup">th</hi> had any power to unite them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. He adds, that notwithſtanding this difference, <hi>they have many things common.</hi> I do agree with him; but that which they may have of common doth not proceed from the particular Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome. The Compariſon of which he makes uſe to prove it is raviſhing and marvellouſly well applied, 'tis of a Man, who participates together both of the Animal and Reaſonable na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. See then according to my ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion how he pretends there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon to form his Argument. As Man, though ſuperiour to Animals, doth participate of their Nature, and hath ſomething in him which is common to them: ſo the Prince, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding he is elevated above the People, yet doth not ceaſe to be ſubject to their Local Cuſtoms. <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum teneatis Amici?</hi> But to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate by this Principle that the Prince is ſubject to Local Cuſtoms,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:101549:118"/>we muſt by a Moral which is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether new eſtabliſh this foundation, That the Senſes ought to give law to Reaſon, and that the Senſual appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite muſt govern the Will; otherwiſe all this diſcourſe would prove no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: this ſtrange Doctrine would make all the Schools rage, and would not take but among the falſe Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors and the bad Interpreters of <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure.</hi> Let us ſay then, the better to conform our ſelves to a more regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar prudence, that if Man in ſome occaſions ought to raiſe himſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Senſes, and free himſelf from the ſubjection of the inferiour part; it is principally in thoſe Actions wherein the eternal Succeſſion is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, which is his principal and laſt End: and that to deſcend by this Rule from the moral to the politick part, it muſt be concluded that there is no caſe wherein the Sovereign ought to be more independent of popular Cuſtoms, then in thoſe of the Sovereign Succeſſions, which ought to conſtitute the Felicitie of
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:101549:118"/>the State, and to eſtabliſh a little kind of Eternity in his Familie.</p>
               <p>But I perceive that I my ſelf do goe aſtray by playing the Philoſopher with theſe Sophiſters, and that I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part inſenſibly from my firſt deſign of deſtroying their Maximes in one bulk, without tying my ſelf to every parcel of their works. Let us paſs then to the ſecond Rule by which thoſe So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Succeſſions are to be meaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red which do hold of the Empire, to wit, by the uſual Cuſtome in the Imperial Fiefs.</p>
               <p>It was never heard of in the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire that any Sovereign Fief ſhould be regulated by the Local Cuſtoms, that it ſhould be ſubject to the Right of Devolution; and even the greateſt part do totally exclude Daughters, and paſs to the Collateral Lines in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of Heirs-male.</p>
               <p>I have already ſhewn that the Cauſe and the principal End of ſuch Succeſſions is an eſſential Reaſon of State, which abſolutely requires, for the good of the People, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:101549:119"/>of great Families, that the Sovereignties ſhould be maintained as long as poſſibly may be in the ſame Line; and that the practice of the contrary would expoſe the States to continual Revolutions: that this End is incomparably more noble, more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levated, and more neceſſary, then that which doth preferr in ſome places a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong private perſons the Daughters of the Firſt Bed before the Males of the Second: that the Reaſons which in ſome ſort may make this Cuſtome tolerable among the Subjects, doth no ways concern the Prince nor the Sovereignty: that Second Marriages, which be oftentimes the cauſe of the ruine of private Families, are ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily the prop and ſuſtentation of Princes Houſes: that that which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers doe voluntarily with an intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate Incontinencie, theſe are obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to doe it by an abſolute neceſſity, for the good of the State and their Family: that the Reaſons which have given occaſion to this Cuſtome have no manner of relation to the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigntie;
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:101549:119"/>from whence it muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded that the Cuſtome can take no place in the caſe where all the cauſes for which it was introduced cannot concurr, and where all the advantages which ariſe from it are counterba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanced by greater Inconveniences.</p>
               <p>It remains to ſee what was the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient practice, and received in all times and without interruption. The Authours of theſe Libells, having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed their ſpirits in ſeeking from all parts materials to make their Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume big, could not yet find one ſingle Example which is truely comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded within the fact in queſtion: Let us trie if we ſhall be more ſucceſsfull.

<pb n="220" facs="tcp:101549:122"/>to himſelf the diſpoſition of them in favour of others.</p>
               <p>The ſame <hi>Godfrey</hi> conſented to a Donation which <hi>Gerard</hi> his Son of the Second Bed had made to the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by of <hi>Everbode,</hi>

               <p>The ſame Trophies of <hi>Butkens</hi> will furniſh us with other Examples of this nature; which by Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences and neceſſary Inductions ſhew that neither Princes nor their

               <p>But let us come to the Donation of the <hi>Low-Countreys</hi> made by <hi>Philip</hi> the Second in favour of the Infanta <hi>Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella.</hi> All its Clauſes and all its Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances are directly oppoſed to the Right of Devolution. <hi>Philip</hi> the Second could not have given what was not his own; a Donation ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes the Proprietie to be in him who gives: the Conſent of the Prince his Son would not have been required, nor ought to have been paſſed, as afterwards it was on the 6. of <hi>May</hi> 1598, if the Right of the Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and of the Proprietie had been fully devolved to the Infanta's his Siſters. This Donation, which was contrary to the Devolution, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to the prejudice of a third per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, would not have been received in that qualitie by all the Eſtates, as it was the 21. of <hi>Auguſt</hi> of the ſame
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:101549:123"/>year: <hi>Philip</hi> could not have aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned them in Portion to his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as it is certain he did by the ſame Act, and that the Archduke <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> accepted and poſſeſſed them by this Title.</p>
               <p>To get out of this bad way, they have recourſe to two Shifts, which ſerve only but to diſcover their Weakneſs. They acknowledge that <hi>Philip</hi> gave theſe Provinces to his Daughter,<note place="margin">Dialogue <hi>fol.</hi> 55.</note> but that it was <hi>to doe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf honour by an Imaginary Liberality.</hi> The Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> ought not to have liked this Game: whence came it then that he did not oppoſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to <hi>this Imaginary Liberality,</hi> which was really deſtroying all his Right? Is it likely that all the Eſtates of the Countrey and the Tribunals of the Provinces would have approved a Chimerical Surrender, and connived at this Cheat, and under the ſole Title of a falſe Donation tendred their Oaths for the whole to her who ſhould not have been Heir but of a part?</p>
               <pb n="223" facs="tcp:101549:123"/>
               <p>The Archduke <hi>Albert</hi>'s Treatie of Marriage with the Infanta <hi>Iſabella</hi> doth not onely confirm this Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but is alſo an evident proof, that the ſole End of the Pragmatick Sanction of the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the V<hi rend="sup">th</hi> above mentioned was the Union and the Indiviſibilitie of all theſe Provinces. It may be ſeen in the 21. Article, <hi>And foraſmuch, &amp;c.</hi> towards the end, where he ſpeaks in theſe terms: <hi>Provided always to be kept and obſerved inviolably all and every one of the Conditions above ſpecified, and the Pragmatick made by the Emperour, my Lord and Father, of Immortal Memory, who may he reſt in Glory, in the month of</hi> November Anno 1549. <hi>concerning the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion of the ſaid</hi> Low-Countreys, <hi>without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting or granting any Diviſion of them, or Separation, for what caſe ſoever, nor in any manner of ways whatſoever.</hi> And a little beneath this in the ſame Article he doth oblige both the Archduke and the Infanta, <hi>to ſuſtain, carry on, and maintain all
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:101549:124"/>and every the Rents, Penſions for life, and all other Gifts whatſoever, which we and our Predeceſſors have given, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned, or granted.</hi> He ſpeaks all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long therein as true Proprietor; he grants theſe Provinces with thoſe things charged upon them, which he could not have impoſed if the Right of Devolution did reach the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigntie; and much leſs oblige the Infanta, to whom the Right had been devolved. In all the other Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles he ſpeaks as abſolute Maſter: <hi>Item, upon condition, and not otherwiſe.</hi> How can it be imagined that the States would have approved ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Clauſes contrary to the Devolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if they had believed that it had place in reference to their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces?</p>
               <p>I believe that they ſhall have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to reply, if I make them ſee that <hi>Henry</hi> the Great (whom the moſt Chriſtian King hath choſen for his Illuſtrious Modell) did authorize this Donation by a ſolemn Treatie, and did acknowledge that <hi>Philip</hi> the
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:101549:124"/>II<hi rend="sup">d</hi> was the right Proprietor of theſe Provinces, and could diſpoſe of them, either by laſt Will, Donation, or in any other manner. This great Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch and his wiſe Miniſters knew perfectly the nature, the uſe, and the extent of the Devolution in Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſo near adjacent to <hi>France.</hi> If they had conceived that it had had any place in the Sovereignties, they would have been careful not to have treated upon any thing of that kinde, which might have prejudged a Right to which the Kings of <hi>France</hi> might ſometime have acquired ſome Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt. Thoſe who treated in the King's name were too circumſpect, and too well verſed in the practice, to ſuffer that any Clauſe ſhould be inſerted in a Treatie contrary to the Cuſtoms, and which one day might prejudice their Crown. From whence it is to be concluded, that the previous Acknowledgment which they made of this Donation which <hi>Philip</hi> the II. deſigned even at that time to make, is a manifeſt confeſſion of their real
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:101549:125"/>ſenſe, that the Right of Devolution had no place in the Sovereignties, as may be ſeen by the VI. Article of the Treatie of <hi>Vervins: 'Tis alſo mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually agreed and conſented to, in caſe his Catholick Majeſtie ſhould either give or transferre by Teſtament, Donation, or in any other way, under any Title whatſoever, to the moſt Serene Infanta</hi> Iſabella <hi>his eldeſt Daughter, or to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, all the Provinces of the</hi> Low-Countreys, <hi>with the Counties of</hi> Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundie <hi>and</hi> Charolois, <hi>that all the ſaid Provinces and Counties ſhall be compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in the preſent Treatie, &amp;c.</hi> In this Article <hi>France</hi> doth acknowledg that not onely <hi>Philip</hi> the II<hi rend="sup">d</hi> might ſurrender, give, and transferre them to his eldeſt Daughter, but alſo to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. <hi>Likewiſe the ſaid Infanta, or he in favour of whom the ſaid Lord the King ſhould diſpoſe thereof, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Authours of theſe Libells muſt needs accuſe not onely one of the greateſt Kings that ever reigned amongſt them of a moſt groſs Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, but alſo the ableſt Miniſters
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:101549:125"/>that have governed their Affairs, to wit, Monſieur <hi>de Belieure</hi> and <hi>de Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery,</hi> or they muſt confeſs that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing they have alledged againſt this Donation hath any ſubſiſtence but in their own imagination.</p>

                  <note place="margin">The ſame, in the ſame page.</note>But the States of the Dutchy (as the Authours of theſe Libells do pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend) <hi>did proteſt that that Donation ſhould not prejudice their Rights, Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms, and Privileges.</hi> In theſe few words there be two evident Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truths. The firſt is, That there will never be found, neither in the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals nor the Archives, any Proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the States againſt this Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and the very texts which he doth cite do clearly ſhew that they accepted of it in the quality of a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. <hi>Scripto Ordinibus caveat, duo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decimum Ceſſionis Articulum</hi> Belgica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum <hi>Provinciarum Libertati &amp; Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiis nihil derogatum aut detrimento fore.</hi> This cannot be called a Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation againſt the Act, but onely a ſimple Reſervation of their Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges, under which they accept the
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:101549:126"/>Surrender, and qualifie it even by this Title; which they would have taken good heed not to have done, if it had been their intention to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Right of Devolution, which muſt have been deſtroyed by this word of <hi>Surrender,</hi> and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the acceptation would have been contrary and prejudicial to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation.</p>
               <p>The other is, That in the ſame De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration there is no mention made of the Cuſtoms, as the Writer doth arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficially adde of his own head, by a privilege which ſuch Authours poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs by a preſcription of many Ages, to ſay whatever they pleaſe without fear of puniſhment. Nothing is ſaid in the paſſage which he cites, but, <hi>de Libertatibus &amp; Immunitatibus,</hi> and lower, <hi>de obſervandis Patriae Privile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giis.</hi> Now he himſelf confeſſes that the Right of Devolution is <hi>a kind of Penaltie introduced out of hatred to Second Marriages.</hi> It is not then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that they meant to comprehend under the name of their Privileges
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:101549:126"/>and Liberties a burthenſom Reſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction which bridles them, and againſt which they themſelves do every day ſeek after Precautions and remedies in their Teſtamentarie diſpoſitions. The Reſervation of the States to preſerve their Privileges and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities was not done either to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe or contradict the Surrender, which they did freely accept, but onely to hinder leſt by that Ceſſion they ſhould fall to be in a worſe condition then that in which they were under <hi>Philip</hi> the II<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, and did not go farther then to oblige the perſon to whom the Surrender was made to the ſame conditions to which the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renderer was bound.</p>
               <p>The Authour of the Queen's Rights doth yet run out with more licence upon the ſame Subject,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 206.</note> by falſely citing of <hi>Meteren</hi> in his Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of the <hi>Low-Countreys.</hi> To make this Hiſtorian ſpeak to his fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, he adds to his Narrative a meer Fiction, contrary to the ſequell and to the ſenſe of his ſtory. <hi>Thoſe of</hi>
                  <pb n="230" facs="tcp:101549:127"/>Brabant (ſays he) <hi>were ſo afraid leſt it ſhould be thought that the Infanta</hi> I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſabella, <hi>to whom this Dutchy belonged by the right of Devolution, ſhould be conceived to hold it by virtue of the Donation, becauſe no mention was made of any Right.</hi> In the end he applies to this falſe Preamble that which <hi>Meteren</hi> relates of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation made by the States, that this Donation might not hurt nor preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice their Rights and Privileges; wherein alſo he doth maliciouſly change the terms of the Proteſtation, which ſpeaks not <hi>of the Rights of the Dutchie,</hi> as he alledges with his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed ingenuitie, but onely of their proper Rights and Privile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, <hi>de obſervandis Patriae Privile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giis,</hi> as the paſſage it ſelf expreſſes, which he hath cited elſewhere. But at the bottom there will nothing be found in <hi>Meteren</hi> that can either di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly or indirectly prove, that the States of <hi>Brabant</hi> made the leaſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion upon the Right of Devolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nor that they refuſed to accept
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:101549:127"/>the Donation in this qualitie; but, on the contrary, that they admitted it under the ſame Title, as alſo the Conſent of the Prince <hi>Philip,</hi> which was contrary to the Right of Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, and that the repugnancie which this Hiſtorian ſaith divers ſhewed in this rencounter was found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on other cauſes, viz. <hi>That it would be held ſtrange, that the Eldeſt Daughter ſhould be beſtowed upon a</hi>

Even the States of the Province (as this ſame Authour reports) never reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to mingle the Devolution among thoſe Cauſes which they alledged for the averſion which they had to the change of a Maſter, but,<note place="margin">Meteren <hi>l.</hi> 9. <hi>fo.</hi> 412.</note> on the
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:101549:128"/>contrary, they produce other Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons which ſeem to deſtroy the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution. Their principal Reaſon was, <hi>Becauſe they had lived ſo many years under the juſt and equitable Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of ſo good a King, and that remembring ſo many Favours, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that it was not poſſible to quit their Obedience to him without a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual remorſe of Conſcience.</hi> Which ſhews that they acknowledged him for their true Proprietor, elſe what remorſe of Conſcience could they have had for going to their lawful<note n="*" place="margin">The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanta <hi>Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella.</hi>
                  </note> Heir by the Right of a Succeſſion Devolved? of which, according to the French doctrine, the King his Father poſſeſſed but the bare uſe and profits, whereof he might have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuded himſelf without giving them any cauſe to think ſtrange of it, ſince that is ordinarily practiſed by the Fathers in the Marriages of their Children, to releaſe unto them the enjoying of thoſe Proprieties which they have acquired. What follows renders the buſineſs much more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:101549:128"/>They ſubmitted themſelves ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs (notwithſtanding the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations which they had to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary) to the will of the King, &amp; alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this Reaſon for their ſo doing, viz. <hi>to give them for their Princeſs, his moſt dear Daughter, of whoſe goodneſs and Vertue they had heard ſo much, and withall for coupling her with a Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, &amp;c.</hi> They do conſent in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the goodneſs and Vertue of the Princeſs, and the great Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Husband, at the ſame time when they profeſs <hi>that he gives her un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them for their Princeſs;</hi> they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge her not to have been ſo before: and if it is the King who gave her unto them, it cannot be the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution that placed her in the Throne. It is for this that in the Conſent which they gave to it they ſay, that it was <hi>to conform themſelves to the will of the King, and provided that his Majeſtie would command them ſo to doe:</hi> which they would never have ſaid, if ſo be that they had held the Infanta for their lawfull Princeſs
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:101549:129"/>by a Right already devolved. This Conſent clearly expreſſes, that it was in the quality of a Portion and Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that the States did receive the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanta to be their Miſtreſs, as is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt by the relation of the ſaid Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian; and that they themſelves requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Conſent of the Prince her Brother, in which he doth declare that <hi>he was induced thereunto for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain great Reaſons and reſpects of the Common good, and to the end that his Siſter might he provided for according to her quality and great merit:</hi> he he qualifies it alſo with the title of <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</hi> All this is ſo contrary to the Devolution, that I cannot admire e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough the blindneſs of this Writer, in having touched upon this ſtring ſo palpablie out of time.</p>
               <p>But though by an exceſs of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence all that they alledge were granted to be true, they are not able to draw any other conſequence from it, but that the States, by accepting of this Surrender, did pretend that they were to remain in their anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:101549:129"/>Rights and forms of Government: and this cannot be underſtood of any but thoſe Rights which relate to themſelves, without pretending there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to touch thoſe of the Prince, nor to ſubject the Sovereignty to their Cuſtoms, ſince in effect that would have been an unjuſt and ridiculous Pretenſion, and which would have made to their own Diſadvantage.</p>
               <p>Let us remove from this point to that of the Surrender and perpetual Alienation made in favour of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates of the United Provinces, by <hi>Philip</hi> the IV<hi rend="sup">th</hi>,<note place="margin">Which was done at the Treatie of <hi>Munſter</hi> in the year 1648,</note> of one part of <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant</hi> and ſome other Provinces. This Donation ought to be null according to all the Rules of theſe Writers, not onely for what concerns the Lands where the Devolution hath place, but for all the others likewiſe. As to the firſt, it is certain that the Caſe of the Devolution was already come to paſs in favour of the Prince <hi>Balthazar,</hi> and, failing of him, in favour of the Queen of <hi>France,</hi> when they were ſurrendred: If this Right be a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:101549:130"/>and certain Succeſſion, if it be a Propriety which can never validly be renounced, it is the duty of the States of the United Provinces to think either handſomly to reſtore them, or elſe to defend their poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion by the Sword: the Sentence is already pronounced, The moſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian King, <hi>not out of a covetous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to conquer, but according to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe obligation of his Duty and Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> is reduced to the neceſſity of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining them in the ſame faſhion as he doth us; he cannot abandon the Rights of his Wife, without failing in what he owes unto her, and what his own proper reputation requires of him.</p>
               <p>As to the other Lands, if it be true, as they affirm it to be, that Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignties are <hi>unalienable; that Princes cannot renounce their Rights in preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice of their Succeſſours,</hi> even by pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Treaties; that thoſe are Rights of Bloud, inſeparably tied to all the poſteritie; that they may pretend Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief even againſt Treaties of Peace
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:101549:130"/>upon the ſcore of Laeſion; in fine, if no conſideration neither of Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage nor of publick Faith can prevail againſt the rules of litigious wrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; behold the Treatie of <hi>Munſter,</hi> concluded with the States of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Provinces, reduced to the ſame inconveniences with the <hi>Pyrenean.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some Objections remain to be ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in particular, which I have not yet touched but very ſuperficially, though they be ſufficiently repelled by the Principles which I have eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed.</p>
               <p>They oppoſe to us in the firſt place the Sentence of the Emperour <hi>Henry</hi> in the year 1230. The ſame Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour <hi>Stockmans</hi> hath very pertinently anſwered it in the 21. Article of his Treatiſe; to which I will onely adde, that this Sentence can have no relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Right of Devolution, for theſe following Reaſons.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. The firſt is, That the whole Narrative on which he founds the Deciſion of the Emperour is meerly the Invention of this Scribbler, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:101549:131"/>that neither the Sentence nor the Hiſtory do mention any ſuch thing, and that it is repugnant to the Text even of the Sentence, which ſpeaks not of the Propriety, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly interdicts the Alienation, which in it ſelf was not permitted to him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Conſent of the States: and what he adds in the Sentence, <hi>Matrem habuerit, &amp; illa fit mortua,</hi> ſhews that it ought not to be underſtood of the Sovereigntie, but of ſome patrimoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Goods belonging to the Prince which might have been affected with the Portion of the deceaſed Mother. For if this Sentence were founded upon the Right of Devolution, he would have made of it ſome expreſs mention, as well as have alledged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother cauſe for it: beſides that, as I have already made appear, the Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution doth not abſolutely hinder, and does not annull the Alienation, but renders it onely ſubject to be reſcin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded after the death of the Father, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining notwithſtanding valid in caſe the Son comes to die before him.</item>
                  <pb n="239" facs="tcp:101549:131"/>
                  <item>2. This Sentence would be unjuſt and contrary to the ſame Cuſtome, if it were founded upon the Devolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, becauſe this Right doth not give the Children that horrible pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er preſently to ſeiſe upon the Goods of the Father in his life-time, becauſe of a ſimple Alienation, but gives them onely a hope to enjoy them after his death, and the right to pretend Relief, and to re-demand what hath been ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enated during his life. Otherwiſe, it were to authorize an unjuſt Violence, which would ſtifle the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; it were to make Children Curatours to their Fathers, and to give them an opportunity to drive them from their Throne. From whence it is neceſſarily to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that the Sentence of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour ought to have ſome other mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, which can be no other then that which I have related. In effect, ſeeing that it is not founded but upon the Death of the Dutcheſs, it muſt needs have had ſome other cauſe then that of Devolution, in regard the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour's
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:101549:132"/>Argument would not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding, The Dutcheſs is dead, then her Husband cannot Alienate; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing certain that he may not onely in ſome caſes, but that the Dutcheſs alſo her ſelf might have renounced this Right by a Diſpoſition amongſt the living, or by one relating to her death.</item>
                  <item>3. If this Sentence did concern the Goods of the Sovereigntie, it would determine nothing at all, by reaſon that by their own nature they cannot be Alienated without the Conſent of the States, who themſelves would have been the firſt to have oppoſed this Alienation; unleſs their Aſſent had been required, and that they had judged it to be founded on the benefit of the State; in which caſe the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour with Juſtice could not have hindered the effect thereof.</item>
                  <item>4. This Sentence was given in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of an Heir-male, and does not inferr that the Daughters of the Firſt Bed ought to exclude the Sons of the Second. Indeed it is horrible and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:101549:132"/>to Reaſon, onely to imagine that ſuch a caſe ſhould ever happen, whereby we might ſee a Daughter upon the Throne to the excluſion of her Brother, and the Son of a Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign become Subject to his Siſter: this ſhocks Nature, which hath given the preeminence to Men, and the rights to command, by reaſon of the excellency of their Sex. The Authour of the Dialogue ſtrives to get out of this difficulty by reſtricting this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral inconvenience to the particular fact which is actually in queſtion:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Fol.</hi> 52.</note> but he runs from the Liſts, and eludes the point in controverſie. He ſpeaks thus: <hi>The Catholick King ſhall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand in his Eſtates, and the moſt Chriſtian Queen in hers, without either of them having any Juriſdiction over the other.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>This Subterfuge is very pleaſant and moſt handſomlie fanſied; at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent he changes the perſon of an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate into that of a Polititian, and makes uſe of the Expedient when he finds not his advantage in litigious
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:101549:133"/>wrangling. It is happy that <hi>Philip</hi> the IV<hi rend="sup">th</hi> left unto his Son other Eſtates: But if he had been onely Duke of <hi>Brabant,</hi> or Prince onely of any one of the other Provinces to which <hi>France</hi> doth pretend, and that the Devolution had place as to Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignties, the caſe had happened wherein the Prince his Son had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Subject to his Siſter. And when we ſpeak of the Monſtrouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which this Cuſtome would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce in it ſelf, and the Inconveniences which may generally ariſe from thence, we do look upon the thing purely in it ſelf, and not in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent circumſtance, which is out of the caſe of the Queſtion, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nd holds no manner of ſimilitud<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>abant</hi> do poſſeſs other Kingdoms, it is a thing meerly accidental in reſpect of the Dutchy and of its Cuſtoms.</p>
               <p>In fine, all that is to be gathered from this Sentence is, that the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour would not permit the Duke to alienate his Goods to the prejudice of
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:101549:133"/>his Son. We cannot inferr from thence any thing in favour of the Devolution, ſince there be a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Imperial Sentences of the ſame nature for Fiefs, in which the right of Devolution never reigned.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Objection is drawn out of the alledged and ill-applied Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſome Doctors, who do maintain that when any difference about Feo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal Cuſtoms is in agitation, it is not to be regulated by thoſe of the Lording, but by thoſe of the Serving Fief.</p>
               <p>It is certain that all of them do ſpeak in this place of thoſe Differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which ariſe upon the Serving Fiefs, which being neither ſo abſolute nor ſo privileged as the Lording, ought not to be meaſured by the ſame Rule: and this makes altogether in our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, to ſhew the advantagious diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence which there is of the greater in regard of the leſſer. Meanwhile they turn the Argument to the oppoſite way, and in ſtead of acknowledging that this Reaſon is ſufficient to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate the diſproportion betwixt the
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:101549:134"/>one and the other, and that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be made equal, they will yet make uſe of it not onely to equalize the Lording Fief with the condition of the Serving, but even to ſubject it to and regulate it by the ſame Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome; although the contrarie doth evidently appear by the very Texts which they cite, and very falſlie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret. The Example is moſt clear in the Citation which they do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce of <hi>Molina</hi> in his Treatiſe of<note n="*" place="margin">The <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joraſque</hi> in <hi>Spain</hi> is the Eldeſt Son's Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle.</note> 
                  <hi>Majoraſques.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They wreſt this paſſage many ways; the Dialogue drags it thus by the hair: <hi>That the Crown of</hi> Spain <hi>being the firſt Majoraſque of the Realm,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Treatiſe of the Rights of the Queen of <hi>France,</hi> fol. 170. Dialog. fol. 40.</note> 
                  <hi>it ought indiſpensablie to conform to the Laws which the Cuſtoms of the Country have introduced for Majoraſques.</hi> To diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the falſe artifice of this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, there needs no more then to confront it with the Text; and then it will be ſeen that it is far from ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting the Sovereignty to Local Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms in order to the Majoraſques; he wills, on the contrary, that all others
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:101549:134"/>ſhould be regulated according to the practice of the Crown: <hi>Ab eóque</hi> (he ſpeaks of the Kingdome) <hi>caetera pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mogenia tanquam à capite derivari, ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedendíque rationem accipere:</hi> from whence he concludes, that every Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs which ariſes from the inferiour Majoraſques, <hi>ſit ſecundùm Leges ad Regni Succeſſionem inſtitutas deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denda.</hi>

               <p>I cannot wonder enough at the blindneſs of this Authour, who puts into our hands the titles which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn him, and yet preſumes to turn them into a ſenſe altogether oppoſite. The Sovereign Fief, according to this Text, is the Rule of all the reſt: how can he then pretend that the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Cuſtoms of other Fiefs ſhould be the Rule of the Sovereign? The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of the Treatiſe of the moſt Chriſtian Queen's Rights makes uſe in ſubſtance of the ſame Subterfuge, but with a little more modeſty:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Fol.</hi> 171.</note> he proves by the Authours which he cites, that <hi>the Majoraſques of</hi> Spain <hi>were inſtituted after the example of
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:101549:135"/>the Royaltie;</hi> but he ſlips in ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of his own, <hi>that the Rules intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced for the Succeſſion of the one were alſo introduced for that of the other;</hi> though it be certain by all this Text, and by what follows of <hi>Covarr.</hi> whom he cites, that the Sovereign Fief gives the Law to all inferiour ones, and conſequently cannot receive it from their particular Cuſtoms. But as he doth falſly cite to us the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Authours, to reduce the Sovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to the Cuſtoms of the Countrie; let us ſee whether their own <hi>French</hi> Authours will agree in this Maxime. Behold what <hi>Peter du Puy,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Du Puy</hi> in the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of the Rights of the King t. c. on the Dutchie of <hi>Bretannie.</hi>
                  </note> very fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous and of great credit among them, ſays upon the Subject of the Succeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Dutchie of <hi>Bretannie,</hi> which makes altogether for our purpoſe. <hi>If this Difference were among particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar perſons and inhabitants of a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, it ſeems that the Infanta of</hi> Spain <hi>might have ſome apparence of Right by means of the Cuſtome, of which ſhe will make uſe: but it being all pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, and all Royal, decided by the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick.
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:101549:135"/>Rights of</hi> France, <hi>known to all the World, we may juſtly be aſtoniſhed how they have dared to preferr to them Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Cuſtoms, which regulate nothing but Differences among private perſons.</hi> Can any thing be clearer then this? The Counſellour <hi>Stockmans</hi> cites <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineus,</hi> and other Authours both <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Germans,</hi> on this Subject, who confirm the ſame thing in ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs terms, that they leave no mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of doubt. The Reader may ſee them cited in the 21. Chapter, and have recourſe, if he think fit, unto the fountain.</p>
               <p>The Authour of the Dialogue is admirable in all, but he ſurpaſſes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in prettineſs, when, outvying <hi>Pythagoras</hi> and <hi>Ovid</hi> in the changes of Forms, he makes the Sovereigntie to appear under divers Metaphyſical Abſtractions, whereof Lawyers till now have been ignorant. At firſt he repreſents it like a Queen, and in a moment after like a mean Citizen: one while he brings it upon the Stage as a married woman, and then again
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:101549:136"/>as a Widow: he kills it, and raiſes it to life again; exalts it, and debaſes it; and into what poſture ſoever he puts it, he hath the dexterity to make it ſtill act its part handſomlie. When 'tis needfull to purſue the Cauſe by Arms, then (forſooth) is it a Sovereigntie that holds of none but God, and that may admit of no other Judge: when he will diſpute it in the Quiddities of Law, it is a ſimple Inheritance, ſubject to the Law of the People. When the Renunciation is treated of or the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, he places it above Kings and Reaſon of State: but when he brings the Devolution into play, he ranks it among Slaves. When it is his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, the Prince muſt be <hi>the Soul of the Cuſtoms:</hi> and when he finds it more to his advantage, he ſubjects the Prince to it. And after all theſe long windings, he finds at the end of his reckoning that he hath fought onely againſt his own Shadow, and that all this Gallimaufrie tends to reduce the Sovereign Succeſſions to the low con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of private Fiefs.</p>
               <pb n="249" facs="tcp:101549:136"/>
               <p>Sovereignties do never die, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the opinion of all the <hi>French</hi> Doctors, their Rights and Prerogatives ſubſiſt ſtill during the <hi>Interregnum,</hi> changing of Maſters al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters nothing in their Juriſdictions and Preeminences. This diſtinction is of no uſe where we handle the Right of Devolution, ſince that it falls even whilſt the Father lives: ſo that if the Devolution hath place in Sovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and if this Right, as they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, be a true Succeſſion and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietie, the Father in effect is no longer Sovereign, becauſe the Right of the Sovereignty is properly and radically affixed to the Proprietie, and not to the Proſſeſſour of the Rents and Fruits. So that in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the Sovereigntie the Prince is to be reckoned of as dead from the firſt moment in which he is a Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dower; he cannot be any more <hi>the Soul of the Cuſtoms,</hi> ſince he hath no more in him the principle of politick Life, being deprived of the Proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of his Dominion; and his Life
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:101549:137"/>might be called an <hi>Interregnum,</hi> and his Sovereigntie a vacant inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. But what would follow upon all this? Would this Sovereigntie without Maſter ceaſe to be a Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigntie? and though it could not eſtabliſh new Laws, would it fall from its ancient and natural Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives? ſhall it be reduced either by the natural or the civil Death of the Prince to the meaſure of the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions of Burgeſſes? would it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come inferiour to its ſelf? If that were true, it would follow that it is the Perſon of the Prince onely which makes it Sovereign: whereas, on the contrary, it is the other ſolely which puts him into the Rights of Sovereigntie.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Page</hi> 172.</note> In truth all the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe which he makes on this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject is ſo confuſed, that it is not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to comprehend what advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage he ſeeks from thence.</p>
               <p>The third Objection is founded upon the Inſtrument of the Treatie of Marriage of the Queen of <hi>France,</hi> in which <hi>Spain</hi> hath covenanted <hi>a
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:101549:137"/>formal and expreſs Derogation to all contrary Cuſtoms:</hi> from whence he will infer this Conſequence, That if the Cuſtoms <hi>did not affect thoſe Goods, Spain</hi> had never ſought to be <hi>diſingaged of that whereby it was not bound.</hi> How can men who affect to be thought Wits dare to fill Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes with ſuch Trifles as theſe be, without apprehending the cenſure of honeſt men? The Derogation which was made to the Cuſtoms is recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, as much on <hi>France</hi>'s ſide as on <hi>Spain</hi>'s: and if the Argument which he takes from it had any kind of force, it would conclude againſt <hi>France,</hi> and render ſubject to the Cuſtoms of <hi>Bretanny</hi> and other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, as well as <hi>Spain</hi> to thoſe of <hi>Brabant.</hi> But who does not ſee that this Derogation does ſtretch it ſelf onely to ſuch Cuſtoms which may tie the Sovereigns, or ſerve as a pretext by right or wrong to form new Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions againſt them? Experience teaches us that we cannot be too cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpect againſt ſuch turbulent ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:101549:138"/>and that it was not enough to take away the Root and the true Cauſes of the evil, but that alſo it was neceſſary to cut off the Shoots and Branches, and not onely remove the Cauſes, but even the Pretexts and Apparences.</p>
               <p>Although the other Reaſons which they do alledge to eſtabliſh their pretended Right to the other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, in which the Devolution is unknown, be entirely ruined by this one Principle, which I think to have ſufficiently proved that Sovereign Succeſſions neither ought to be nor can be regulated by Local Cuſtoms; I will not omit to adde one word more by the way touching this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, till ſuch time as the Lawyers of thoſe places, who are better verſed in the nature of their particular Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms, ſhall be able to give to the publick a more exact account of them.</p>
               <p>He ſtrives to prove by three Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, that the Seigniourie of <hi>Mechlen</hi> belongs to the Infanta by this ſame
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:101549:138"/>Right of Devolution. The firſt is the Cuſtome, which, as he pretends, hath introduced the Devolution into that Land. I have already ſhewn that this doth not concern the Crown. The ſecond is the Union which was made of this Land to the Dutchie of <hi>Brabant</hi> by <hi>Philip</hi> ſurnamed <hi>the Bold,</hi> and confirmed by the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the V<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. This Union doth not render it dependent upon <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant,</hi> as it is really notorious that it doth not. The third is the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed Practice, that all moveable Fiefs of <hi>Brabant</hi> are to be regulated by the Feodal Cuſtome of that Dutchie. He doth here contradict himſelf, ſeeing that a moment after he hath raiſed this Lordſhip to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of a Sovereigntie, he will make it to depend on the Dutchie of <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant;</hi> wherein he is groſſely miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, being it is certain that it doth not hold of it in any kind. After he hath declared it to be inſeparable from <hi>Brabant,</hi> he will make it ſubject to the Feodal Cuſtome, by virtue
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:101549:139"/>whereof it might be alienated as well as all the other particular moving Fiefs of the ſame Juriſdiction, which are every day parted and divided a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Succeſſors, as I have already made appear. Let us ſay then, that they are Sovereignties united under the ſame Privileges, but Independent of one another, which may have, and have in effect different Cuſtoms; and that Sovereignties, as I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready proved, not being ſubject to Devolution, that of <hi>Mechlen</hi> cannot have been made liable thereunto by this Union, which takes nothing from it of its proper Sovereignty.</p>
               <p>All that he alledgeth touching the Upper <hi>Gelderland,</hi> the County of <hi>Namur,</hi> and the Dutchie of <hi>Limbourg,</hi> ſeeing it is onely grounded upon the Devolution, and their Union with <hi>Brabant,</hi> falls of it ſelf, I having be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore deſtroyed all the Foundation. But he falls alſo here into another Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, ſuppoſing, either out of a real or an affected Ignorance, that <hi>Gel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derland</hi> and <hi>Limbourg</hi> are united to
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:101549:139"/>
                  <hi>Brabant,</hi> which will never be found.</p>
               <p>The other Rights upon <hi>Hainault, Luxemburg</hi> and <hi>Burgundie,</hi> are almoſt of the ſame nature, and founded on this falſe Principle, That Sovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ought to be regulated by the Local Cuſtoms: wherein he falls in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a new contradiction. For in the Treatiſe of the Queen's Rights,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Fol.</hi> 166.</note> in the place above cited, he confeſſes that the Prerogatives which the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Fiefs have above others are, that they are unalienable, and indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible; and yet notwithſtanding, by ſubjecting <hi>Luxemburg</hi> and <hi>Burgundie</hi> to the Local Cuſtom, he makes them both liable to diviſion, <hi>Burgundie</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to three parts, and <hi>Luxemburg</hi> into two: which renders yet more mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt what difference there is betwixt the Lording and the Serving Fiefs, and the Prerogative which the firſt have over the others by his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion. And it cannot be compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended which way he pretends to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile theſe two oppoſites, that the Sovereign Succeſſion is indiviſible in
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:101549:140"/>its own nature, and yet ſubject at the ſame time to a Cuſtom which would make it diviſible. But finally, both in <hi>Burgundie</hi> and in <hi>Luxemburg</hi> it is permitted unto Fathers to make Teſtaments and Subſtitutions, and the moſt part of the principal Fiefs are provided to the Eldeſt Sons by the diſpoſitions of private perſons: If then they will reduce the Prince to the condition of a private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and the Sovereigntie to the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of Local Cuſtoms, they ſhould at leaft doe him the favour to make him equal in every thing with his own Subjects, and ſhould not rob him, as they do, of the power which the meaneſt Citizens enjoy, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of their Goods by Will as they think beſt themſelves, without being obliged to leave any more unto their Daughters then barely their Legal Portion. But the very Reaſon which they do alledge to overthrow the deceaſed King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, doth plainly ſhew the preemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence of Sovereign Fiefs, and that
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:101549:140"/>they are ſo unalienable, that the Princes themſelves have not the right to diſpoſe of them at their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, to the prejudice of the Supreme Law of the State, which being above the Prince himſelf, would be too much humbled if it were made infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to the Cuſtom of Subjects.</p>
               <p>It will be found throughout all the Annals, and by the courſe of Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions in all theſe Sovereignties which they pretend to, that they were never diſmembred nor divided, though there have been frequently many Brothers and Siſters, who, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the particular Cuſtom, might have had right to pretend to the Diviſion of them, if theſe So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Fiefs were of the ſame nature with the others.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> Dukes and Earls of <hi>Burgundie, Mary, Charles</hi> his Grandchild, <hi>Philip</hi> the Second, Third, and Fourth, left many Children; and yet this Countie was never ſubject to Diviſion, which the Authour of this Libell labours to extend from
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:101549:141"/>private Fiefs to Sovereignties. And if we will look yet higher into the matter, it will be found that this Rule hath always remained invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable in the Succeſſion of its Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
               <p>Whereupon ſeveral Obſervations may be made.
<list>
                     <item>The firſt, That this order of Succeſſion hath been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in all the Provinces to which <hi>France</hi> doth pretend, and that this ſhews that of their own nature they have always been indiviſible.</item>
                     <item>2. That the Males have ever ſucceeded, to the excluſion of Daughters.</item>
                     <item>3. That all the Local Cuſtoms which theſe Authours do alledge have never taken place in all theſe Sovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</item>
                     <item>4. That the Right of Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution never had effect in reference to Princes on any occaſion; otherwiſe <hi>Catharine</hi> Dutcheſſe of <hi>Savoy</hi> had ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded <hi>Iſabella</hi> her Siſter, and ſo much the rather becauſe ſhe had not at all renounced.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>It ſeems that he ſeeks onely to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert himſelf in all the diſcourſe he
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:101549:141"/>makes touching the Countie of <hi>Hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nault,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of the Queen's Rights, <hi>page</hi> 365.</note> and that by the Examples and Allegations which he produces he will ſet forth his Memory to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of his Judgment. It is not here the place to diſpute whether <hi>Hainault</hi> be a Fief or a Free-hold, ſince in the one as well as the other Title the Right of the Queen is equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ill founded. The Sentence which he cites in favour of <hi>Jaqueline</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs of <hi>Hainault</hi> againſt the Biſhop of <hi>Liege</hi> is wholly from the purpoſe, ſeeing it is out of controverſie that the Daughters do ſucceed in this Countie, failing of Heirs-male of the ſame Line. The Point in queſtion was to prove that the Daughters of the Firſt Bed did exclude the Males of the Second in the Succeſſion of this Countie: yet of this he is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ſilent, and all the remainder of his diſcourſe is but a ſtraying and a vain <hi>Caracole</hi> out of his courſe; and after he hath run himſelf out of wind, without being able to make any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion upon thoſe Grounds which
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:101549:142"/>have coſt him ſo much pains to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh them, he retires like a <hi>Cacus</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his den of the particular Cuſtoms, which is his onely refuge.</p>
               <p>But it is here where he hath loſt all manner of Modeſty, when he dares affirm that the Cuſtom of the place prefers the Daughters of the Firſt Bed before the Males of the Second. If he had conſulted the Practitioners of the Countrey, they would have informed him of the Uſe inviolably obſerved among them, and founded upon their Cuſtom, which gives the preference to the Males without any diſtinction of Bed in the Succeſſion of Fiefs; they would have let him ſee, in the 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle 6. of their Cuſtoms, that the Daughters of the Firſt Bed ſhould remain without any part in the Fiefs of their Fathers, and that the Males of the Second ſhould abſolutely carry them by the diſpoſition of the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom, according to their ordinary Rule; if the ſame Cuſtom had not permitted the Fathers and Mothers
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:101549:142"/>to provide a remedie in this by a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Diſpoſition. Theſe are the very words of the Cuſtome: <hi>Two Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncts having onely one Daughter may make and paſs advice to her profit out of their Fiefs and Allodes and main Farms, either wholly or in part of them, even by charging one piece or more of the Rents hereditarie, or</hi> Via<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geres, <hi>revocable or irrevocable, as if they had many Children; to the end that if from the ſaid Conjuncts, or from other ſubſequent Marriages, Sons ſhould come, the ſaid Daughter may have a Portion.</hi> It is clearer then the day that the End of this Cuſtome is, to give the Fathers a remedy againſt the practice and the general Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome which prefers the Males of the Second Bed, to hinder that the Daughters may not be left without any part at all, as it would happen if the Parents did make no diſpoſition to the contrary. It is alſo ſeen by the ſame Text, that regularly the Parents had not the power to make even this Diſpoſition, and that they
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:101549:143"/>did receive it onely by this Cuſtome, <hi>may make and paſs advice:</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they could not doe it if this Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome did not give them the power, otherwiſe it would be ſuperfluous and without effect.</p>
               <p>The 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Article of the ſame Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome doth ſo neatly interpret the preceding, that if the Writer had but taken the pains to reade it, he would not have ſo inconſiderately hazarded upon a Propoſition which tends to deſtroy all his credit, the terms whereof are theſe: <hi>And though by the Law, if there be no advice, the Fiefs patrimonial of the Survivor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the Son of the Second Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, when there is onely a Daughter of the Firſt Bed; nevertheleſs the ſaid Fiefs being ordained by advice to the Daughter,</hi> (as in the preceding Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle) <hi>or to many of the former Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, ſuch an Ordinance ſhall take place, to the excluſion of the Son of the Second Marriage:</hi> which is in the publick an univerſal practice, and without contradiction throughout all this Province.</p>
               <pb n="263" facs="tcp:101549:143"/>
               <p>As to the Country of <hi>Namur,</hi> though particular Goods there be ſubject to the Devolution, it is as true that the Sovereigntie is exempt from it; that it is ſeen at this hour by the Contract of Sale which the Earl <hi>John</hi> made to the behoof of the Duke of <hi>Burgundie</hi> in the year 1421. that he parted with the ſaid Countrey to this Duke upon Conditions which are inconſiſtent with the Devolution, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſold it to him for himſelf and his Heirs which ſhould be Earls of <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> without ever being able to be ſeparated from that Countie. This Inſeparabilitie doth neceſſarily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the Devolution, and the rather, becauſe the Countie of <hi>Flanders</hi> to which it is united doth no ways ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge this Cuſtome.</p>
               <p>As for what concerns <hi>Artois,</hi> the Cuſtome which he cites is not recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; and the diſpoſition of the 27<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Article which he alledges extends no farther then to the Goods that are ſituated within the Sheriffdom of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras,</hi> as is clear by the preceding Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles,
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:101549:144"/>and in the Text of the ſame Cuſtome, which cannot onely not be a Law to the Sovereigntie, but cannot ſo much as be a Rule to the other Lands of the Countrey, which hath its general and received Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms, failing whereof it hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to the written Law. And though this Cuſtome of <hi>Arras</hi> gives ſome right to the Children upon the Goods of the Survivor, it is notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding far different from the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution in all its effects, as thoſe may obſerve who ſhall have the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity to reade it. And it is ſo li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited to the place, that though it affects the Movables, yet thoſe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſeiſed on which are out of the Sheriffdom. But by the general and the received Cuſtome of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, there is neither Devolution nor Interveſtiture, (as they call it:) on the contrary, by the 139. Article the Survivor inherits one half of all the Movables of the firſt deceaſed, and by the 134. the Husband hath the Adminiſtration of all the Goods
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:101549:144"/>of his Wife, and can alienate the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveables without her conſent; which is altogether oppoſite to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terveſtiture. The 176. Article, which is urged againſt us, concerns not the Children of the Firſt Bed, ſo much the more, becauſe that in the 94. the Eldeſt carries away all the Fiefs without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of the firſt or ſecond Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, and ſucceeds for his ſhare with the Children both of the one and the other Bed.</p>
               <p>The Texts which he alledges a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this drawn from the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Article, Chapter 105, and from the 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, Chapter 91, and others, are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied by this Authour directly againſt the true ſenſe, and the ordinary pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the Cuſtome: For if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider <hi>Hainault</hi> as a Fief, it is out of doubt that the Males of the Second Bed do exclude the Daughters of the Firſt; of which the practice is ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly obſerved in all the Tribunals of that Province, that it is to goe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly againſt a known Truth to bring this Queſtion ſo much as in Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie.
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:101549:145"/>From whence it follows, that the Cuſtoms which he cites cannot be underſtood in reference to Fiefs, but where there is a concurrence of Male againſt Male, or of Daughter againſt Daughter, of two Beds; in which caſe the Male of the firſt Marriage carries it before thoſe of the Second Bed, and the ſame doth the Daughter of the Firſt Marriage before thoſe of the Latter: But when the Queſtion is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Male and Female, the thing is out of all debate in favour of the Male. But if, on the contrary, they will make <hi>Hainault</hi> paſs for a Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, it is indubitable that the Father may diſpoſe of it by Advice and by Teſtament, and alſo by Subſtitution; as is certain by the 6. Article of the ſame, Chapter 105. The 9. Article of the 94. Chapter which he cites ſpeaks onely of thoſe Fiefs that come by Collateral Succeſſion, and cannot be made a Precedent in relation to Free-holds, which the Parents may diſpoſe of: and that which he adds, that according to the ſame Cuſtome
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:101549:145"/>the direct Donations do paſs for Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaces, is abſolutely falſe, when the Donation is made under the Title of a Portion: and it is a monſtrous thing, that they ſhould offer to make paſs for a Purchace the Reverſion of thoſe Provinces in the perſon of <hi>Philip</hi> the IV<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, ſince it was expreſsly provided in the ſaid Donation, and that King <hi>Philip</hi> the Second and the Prince his Son had never conſented to it but under this Clauſe of Reverſion: ſo that in the recovery of theſe Fiefs they are returned into their firſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, of being the Legal Patrimonie of the Line of <hi>Philip</hi> the II<hi rend="sup">d</hi>; and they did alwaies remain ſuch, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Donation, and chiefly in what relates to <hi>Hainault.</hi> For if it be conſidered as a Free-hold having been given with a Clauſe of Reverting, it ſtaies alwaies in its qualitie of Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie; and if it be a Patrimonial Fief, it is in the ſame qualitie likewiſe that it returns back again to the Giver. We might alſo ſay that as being a Fief it could not be legally given away,
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:101549:146"/>ſince it is certain that the Fathers in the County of <hi>Hainault</hi> may not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of them by Advice, but by way of Diſinheriting: ſo that on which ſide ſoever it be taken, it is impoſſible <hi>France</hi> ſhould finde their advantage. But 'tis to dwell too long upon theſe Cuſtomary practices, and to injure Princes, to weigh their Rights in ſo weak and ſo unequal a Balance.</p>
               <p>I cannot here omit, in paſſing, to deſire the Reader to obſerve one notable Artifice by which <hi>France</hi> would give a falſe weight to her bad Cauſe by begg'd Authorities, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilie ſtolen by a wittie Surprize. The Authour of the Queen of <hi>France</hi>'s Rights makes his great Batterie there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and thinks to confound the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders with theſe ſpecious words, of U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſities which <hi>France</hi> hath conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, of Doctours from all parts who have ſubſcribed to their Opinions; and, if we will believe him, our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation is decreed by the unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous conſent of all the moſt renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Lawyers. But becauſe he is in
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:101549:146"/>poſſeſſion of never reporting matters of fact in their true circumſtances, his bad memory ought to be a little helped, and he made remember, that they have indeed attempted ſome U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſities and particular Doctours to maintain theſe Opinions, of which ſome have fallen into the Trap, and now deteſt their inconſiderate Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; others have had a ſharper ſight, and would give no Deciſion upon ſo indeterminate a fact and ill explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: The Queſtion hath been propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to them under borrowed names, without reducing it to the terms of the true Fact whereof at preſent we are treating; they never mentioned to them that Sovereignties were the thing in queſtion, whereof ſome are Fiefs of the Empire, and others inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent; they concealed the Act and the Clauſes of the Renunciation, as well as its Cauſes and the End thereof; they never knew that it was covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by a Treatie of Peace between two Kings, &amp; agreed to by a Contract of Marriage inſeparable from that of
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:101549:147"/>the Peace; they were never told of the cauſes which <hi>France</hi> had given to the delay of the Payment of the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; they took a great deal of care not to make it appear that the Goods which they pretended to were inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably united among themſelves by a Fundamental Law of the State; and without furniſhing them with any of thoſe inſtructions which might have been uſefull to them in the framing of a ſolid judgment, they ſatisfie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with the meer queſtioning them upon the right of Devolution, and with the inquiring of them whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a Father could alienate his Goods to the prejudice of a Right devolved to his Children, If a Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter might renounce a Succeſſion which was fallen to her, If a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor might be relieved againſt an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>normous Laeſion, If a Renunciation made purely in contemplation of the Portion ought to hold, when the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath not been aſſigned upon the Goods of the Father, and that the very payment had not its effect; and
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:101549:147"/>ſo of the reſt. They have anſwered to theſe Propoſitions according to the diſpoſition of Common Law and the practice of the Local Cuſtoms. But from whence comes it that the <hi>French</hi> Writers, who have ſtuffed their works with ſo many unuſefull Allegations, durſt never produce any of theſe Conſultations, which, no doubt, (had they touched the Caſe) would have been of more force then all that they have alledged in their works? The cauſe of this ſilence is eaſily to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vined: It is by reaſon that they could not ſpread them abroad without diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering at the ſame time the vain il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion of their captious proceeding, and overturning all the ſtrength of theſe ſame Authorities, by detecting that they were all ſurreptitiouſly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted.</p>
               <p>But to put the buſineſs home to them, we ſhall willingly conſent that the fact be reduced to its true Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and that it be referred to the Judgment of the moſt famous Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities in <hi>Europe,</hi> excepting onely
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:101549:148"/>thoſe who by preoccupation of mind, or by the common ſubjection of their Countrey, are not in a condition to think that which they ought, nor to utter ingenuouſly that which they think.</p>
               <p>Let us conclude this Article then with a Dilemma, which proves de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtratively that the Queen of <hi>France</hi> hath no manner of Right, which way ſoever this buſineſs be looked upon. For either the Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution hath place as to the Sovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, or not. If it be received in them, then the<note n="*" place="margin">The Houſe of <hi>Savoy.</hi>
                  </note> Succeſſours of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tharine</hi> are the lawfull Lords of all the Lands which are ſubject to this Cuſtom; this is unqueſtionable. But if the Devolution be of no force in relation to Lording Fiefs, all the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions which <hi>France</hi> doth build on this Title are annihilated. So that all this great heap of Titles and inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which he hath with ſo much ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citude gathered together to uphold the Right of the Queen of <hi>France,</hi> cannot operate (though it were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:101549:148"/>of) but in favour of a third partie; and thus thinking to plead the Cauſe of the Queen, he hath acted onely for the Duke of <hi>Savoy.</hi>

               <argument>
                  <p>A Diſcourſe touching the Intereſt of Chriſtian Princes in this War, and the precife Obligation of the Eſtates of the Empire for the Warrantie of the Circle of <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundy</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THere are two Motives of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent nature which ought to incite the Princes of Chriſtendom to undertake the defence of our Cauſe; the one is the Intereſt of State, the other is a ſtrict Obligation of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice. The firſt regards generally all the Potentates of <hi>Europe;</hi> the ſecond is particular onely to the Princes and States of the Empire: the one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon their foreſight and their wiſe Conduct; the other is joyned to
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:101549:149"/>the duty of the laſt, to the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Laws of their State, to the Treaties of Peace and Warrantie, and to the reciprocal bond which u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites all the Members of this vaſt Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, which makes all its Greatneſs and Glory, and which is the onely foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of its Quiet and Safety. We will begin with the firſt, as being more univerſall, and more conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red at this day in the World; and that will guide us inſenſibly to the ſecond; to let both the one and the other ſee, that our Buſineſs is theirs, that our Commotion is their Trouble, and our Fall their own Ruine. It is our buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs here to uphold the Law of Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which is common to all, and to hinder that Maximes may not be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced into the World which would deſtroy the whole Commerce of mankind, and render humane So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties as dangerous as the company of Lions and Tigers. Here it is our deſign to defend the publick Faith of Treaties againſt the Subtilties of liti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Pleading; to preſerve the Law
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:101549:149"/>of Arms within the Rules and Forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities which the univerſal Conſent of all Nations hath eſtabliſhed; and to remove out of the ſight of Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom a ſcandalous Example, which by its lamentable conſequences would expoſe the weakeſt to the diſcretion of the more powerfull, and would make Force the ſole Arbiter of all Proceſſes. We treat of the way to ſtop the courſe of a rapid Torrent, againſt the Impetuoſity whereof Peace, Marriage, Oaths, Bloud, Kindred, Friendſhip, and Conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcenſions are not Banks ſtrong enough to keep it within its Chanel. It is our purpoſe to defend the common Bulwark againſt a vaſt Deſign, which hath for its cauſe nothing but the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant deſire of Conqueſts, for its end Dominion, for its means Arms and Intricacies, nor for its limits any thing but what Chance will preſcribe. In fine, we are here to decide the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of <hi>Europe,</hi> and to pronounce the Sentence either of its Freedom or Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verie.</p>
               <pb n="276" facs="tcp:101549:150"/>
               <p>Here I reſolve to ſhake off all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of intereſſed thoughts which I may have for my party; I will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider my ſelf in this Article no more then as a ſimple Citizen of the World: and to ſhelter my ſelf the better from all ſuſpicions of Partialitie, I will found my Diſcourſe on no other Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples but thoſe which I ſhall draw out of <hi>French</hi> Authours.</p>
               <p>Since the Providence of God was pleaſed to raiſe the moſt Auguſt Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> to this high pitch of Greatneſs which hath dazled the eyes of Envy, we have ſeen growing in the heart of <hi>France</hi> the lamentable ſeeds of this unjuſt Emulation, which for ſo many years together hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced all the Misfortunes &amp; Troubles of Chriſtendom. The principal Game of the <hi>French</hi> hath been, to diffuſe this Jealouſie everywhere, and to render its Jaundice contagious, repreſenting unto all the other Princes the Power of this Auguſt Houſe as a fearfull Phantaſm which would ſwallow them up, and giving themſelves out for the
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:101549:150"/>onely <hi>Perſeus's</hi> able to deliver fettered <hi>Europe</hi> from the fury of this Chimeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Monſter, whereof they had made to them a vain Bugbear. But expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience hath made it known, that they onely did render our Power ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, to raiſe their own; that they did fright others with us, onely to make themſelves neceſſary; and did not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them their protection, but to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come their Maſters, and make them the Inſtruments of their Ends. Many have blindly fallen into this ſnare, and, to avoid an imaginary Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, have thrown themſelves into a real Precipice. This Artifice was ſo ſucceſsfull, that a part of <hi>Europe</hi> put it ſelf in Arms againſt the Valour and Good fortune of <hi>Charles</hi> the V<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, and the profound Wiſedom of his Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſour: and all this Commotion was founded upon one onely Principle of State which the <hi>French</hi> Writers have eſtabliſhed with an extraordinary di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, and upon which the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> had made roul all his Treatiſe of the Intereſt of Princes; <hi>That there are
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:101549:151"/>two Powers in Chriſtendom which be like the two Poles, from whence all the Influences of Peace and War do deſcend upon the other States.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From whence he draws this Maxime to regulate the Conduct of all other Princes, That their principal Intereſt is to hold the Balance ſo equally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt theſe two Great Monarchies, that neither of them, either by the way of Arms or Negotiation, may e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver come to prevail notablie; and that in this Equality doth ſolely conſiſt the Repoſe and Safety of all the reſt. Though he doth applie this Maxime very ill to the particular uſe of <hi>France,</hi> and artificially ſerves his turn with it as of a falſe Lure, inſenſibly to draw all the other Potentates into the <hi>French</hi> nets; it is notwithstanding ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry wholſome in it ſelf, and if it had been managed with all the vigour and prudence which was neceſſary to render it uſefull, <hi>Europe</hi> at this day ſhould enjoy a perfect Tranquillitie. But many have been miſtaken by a falſe ſuppoſition, that the Power and
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:101549:151"/>the Deſigns of <hi>Spain</hi> were more to be apprehended then thoſe of <hi>France;</hi> and that by this very Reaſon of State they were obliged to put the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoiſe into the <hi>French</hi> Scale of the Balance.</p>
               <p>'Tis eaſie to believe that at preſent none will be found not fully undecei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of this errour in matter of Fact, which hitherto made them abandon their true Reaſon of State. But to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine this Queſtion in its fountain, and in every circumſtance belonging thereunto, it will be to the purpoſe to compare the moſt flouriſhing State of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> under the glorious Reigns of <hi>Charles</hi> the V<hi rend="sup">th</hi> and <hi>Philip</hi> the II<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, and the Maximes of theſe two Princes, with the preſent ſtate and manner of acting of <hi>France;</hi> and then it will be clearly diſcerned by this parallel, that all which was apprehended from us at that time by a Panick fear, now is to be fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and prevented in regard of the <hi>French,</hi> by the ſolid principles of a true Prudence.</p>
               <pb n="280" facs="tcp:101549:152"/>
               <p>To diſcourſe well of this, we muſt conſider the Situation both of the one and the other Monarchie, the Genius of the Princes which govern them, and the Inclinations of their People, the Maximes of their Government, and the circumſtances of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct both paſſed and preſent. This would require a large Diſcourſe; I ſhall content my ſelf onely to touch, in paſſing by, the Eſſentials, and leave the Conſequences to the conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Readers.</p>
               <p>The Monarchie of <hi>Spain</hi> is a large Machine which cannot eaſily be ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, but which cannot likewiſe move with the Agilitie which is neceſſarie to forein Enterpriſes. The Situation of this Monarchie is advantagious for its own Defence, being compaſſed with the Sea and the <hi>Pyrenean</hi> Mountains: but it is inconvenient for invading o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther States, becauſe of the defect of a nearer conjunction betwixt the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers thereof, which cannot hold any Communication with one another but by the large Chanels of the Ocean
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:101549:152"/>and the Mediterranean Sea, which do expoſe their Deſigns to all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries of Weather, and to the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancie of an Element on which no juſt meaſures can ever be taken. The Union of the Empire to the power of <hi>Spain</hi> in the perſon of <hi>Charles</hi> the V<hi rend="sup">th</hi> was rather a ſtep to the deſign of becoming greater, then any addition to his power: he eſpou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with the Empire all the Quarrels of Religion and of State which the conjuncture of thoſe times had ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up in that great Body, which did take up, in favour of others, the moſt part of his care and forces. In a word, this powerful Monarchie ſeems to have been raiſed by God to be the Bulwark of the reſt, againſt the <hi>Turk</hi> in <hi>Hungarie</hi> and in <hi>Italie,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Moors</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> and againſt <hi>France</hi> both in the <hi>Low-Countreys</hi> and in <hi>Italie:</hi> But the neighbourhood of theſe three Powers by which it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vironed is a ſtrong barr to ſtop its Deſigns, if it ſhould endeavour to form too vaſt ones.</p>
               <pb n="282" facs="tcp:101549:153"/>
               <p>The Genius of its Princes is ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to its Situation; They are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally Courteous, and inclined to Vertue; and if they have exceeded in any thing, it never was but in Goodneſs. <hi>Charles</hi> the V<hi rend="sup">th</hi> loved noble Glory; but he had ſo little Ambition, that he reſigned the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire to his Brother, and all his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms to his Son, and uſed his Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries with ſo great Moderation, that he reaped no other benefit thereby, then the Honour to have overcome, and the ſatisfaction to have preſerved his Realms.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Philip</hi> the Second, according to the confeſſion of the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> himſelf, had no inclination at all to Arms, nor ever took them up but for his Defence, or out of neceſſitie to humble thoſe who fomented Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions within his Kingdomes.</p>
               <p>It is to joyn two inconſiſtent things, to repreſent him in one and the ſame time as an enemie to War, and yet ardent to obtain Conqueſts. His Succeſſours have been endowed
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:101549:153"/>with ſo rare Clemency, that their activeneſs had never appeared to the eyes of the World, if the neceſſity of their defence had not excited and in a manner conſtrained them to ſhew themſelves. The people of <hi>Spain,</hi> and of the other Kingdoms which live under the ſame Dominion, are naturally friends to Quietneſs, ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to Noveltie, ſatisfied with their preſent Condition, and have not the leaſt propenſion or itching to trouble their Neighbours. But if we conſider the Maximes which theſe great Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces have followed, we ſhall find that the principal to which they have moſt adhered are directly oppoſite to thoſe of Conquerours.</p>
               <p>The firſt is, To keep inviolably the Faith of publick Treaties, which are powerful bridles to the Ambition of a Prince who deſires to extend his Limits, and do put great obſtacles to his Deſigns, by making him a <hi>Slave to his Word.</hi> It cannot be found in all the Lives of theſe Monarchs, ſince the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the V<hi rend="sup">th</hi>
                  <pb n="284" facs="tcp:101549:154"/>till our time, that ever they have broken or prevaricated in any Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, nor began a War for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larging of their Limits.</p>
               <p>The ſecond, To prefer Religion always before Reaſon of State; which is directly contrary to the Rule of Conquerours, who do dexterouſly make uſe of all ſorts of Sects to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs their own Ends.</p>
               <p>The third, Not to make uſe of their Victories, and the Advantages of their Arms, nor of thoſe of their Allies: for we find that in all the Actions of thoſe<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Charles</hi> the V<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, <hi>Philip</hi> the II<hi rend="sup">d</hi>.</note> two great Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs, they never applied any one of their Conqueſts to their own par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular benefit, except what did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long unto them by juſt Succeſſions.</p>
               <p>The fourth, To rule according to the Laws, and leave their People in the peaceable poſſeſſion of their Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges; which amongſt Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours would paſs for an eſſential fault, againſt the firſt Principles of their Politicks, which require before all other things, that they make
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:101549:154"/>themſelves abſolute and independent at home, and that they break all the Chains of Domeſtick Laws which might hinder their actings abroad.</p>
               <p>The fifth, Never to admit neither League, nor Alliance, nor Commerce, nor Peace with the common Enemie of Chriſtendom. This is a bad un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking of the Deſign of rendring themſelves Maſters of <hi>Europe,</hi> when they draw upon themſelves the emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation and the hatred of the Tyrant of <hi>Aſia.</hi> Let us adde to all theſe things the mature Circumſpection which they obſerve in their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, which renders their Reſolutions more ſlow, and leſs active, then is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite to a Conquerour, who ought to give more to Fortune then to Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. This made a famous <hi>French</hi> Authour ſay,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Malherbe</hi> in his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtles.</note> 
                  <hi>If it were true that</hi> Spain <hi>aſpired to the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchie, he would adviſe them to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire God to grant a reſpite of the end of the World.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>France</hi> is a Kingdome that hath all its Parts united, abounding with
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:101549:155"/>Men, induſtrious in Commerce, which gains with their Baubles and their Modes the money of all other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which hath considerable Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours upon the Ocean and the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terranean Sea, and in their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood no conſiderable powers to fear but that of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Genius of the Nation is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally inclined to Arms, full of heat, unquiet, lovers of Novelty, deſirous of Conqueſts, quick, active, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinable to all manner of Expedients which they conceive to be advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous to their particular Ends.</p>
               <p>The Maximes of their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (according to what may be gathered from their Conduct both paſſed and preſent, by their own Writers, and by the ſame Treatiſe of the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi>) are the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>Firſt, To entertain always War abroad, and exerciſe their young No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility at the expence of their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.</p>
               <p>This is a moſt politick Maxime,
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:101549:155"/>and moſt ſuiting with their own uti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, but moſt troubleſom to all the reſt of the World. In effect, it is certain that the Genius of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is ſuch, that it cannot endure to ſubſiſt long in the Idleneſs of Peace; there muſt: be Aliment for this Fire, and if ſome were not given it from abroad, it would form to it ſelf mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter at home. To this natural Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion muſt yet be added the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of moſt part of their Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and the particular Diſpoſitions of Noble Families, which give ſo great advantages to the Elder Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that they leave almoſt nothing to the younger but their Induſtry and Sword: and as they do not cultivate Letters, and their Quality ſuffers them not to apply themſelves to Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanick Trades; there is nothing left to them but the Warrs or Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beries, to preſerve themſelves from Miſerie. Whence it comes that this Kingdom always finds it ſelf filled with an idle and boyling Youth, ready to undertake all, and which
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:101549:156"/>ſeeks employment for their valour, at whoſe coſt ſoever it be. The li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie which they had heretofore of voiding this Bilious humour, and of running to ſuppoſititious glory by ſingle Combats, is at preſent taken from them by juſt Decrees: the little ſhifts of Induſtry by which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly they ſheltred themſelves from want are now ſeverely prohibited: But at the ſame time that all ways are ſhut unto them, whereby to open their ſpleen in their own Countrey, the Polititians of <hi>France</hi> held it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to furniſh them with another gate by which they might evaporate this Flame, which would gnaw their own Bowels if it did not find another vent.</p>
               <p>Moreover, as the greateſt Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues of the Crown of <hi>France</hi> conſiſt in the Purſe of the People, and that the exceſſive Contributions cannot be exacted in times of Peace, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out making a great many Malecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents; it is neceſſary to feed them with the ſmoke of ſome Conqueſts,
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:101549:156"/>and always to have pretexts to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in Arms, and maintain by force the Royal Authority, which hath ſo ſtrangely overflowed the limits of their Fundamental Laws.</p>
               <p>As it is impoſſible for them to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie all the Princes and great men of their Realm, and that ever ſince the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the III<hi rend="sup">d</hi> they have taken it for a Rule of their Conduct, to bring them low ſo far as they can; it is extremely convenient to hold them imployed in forrein Wars, and to incite them to glory, that they may be conſumed in ruinous under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings.</p>
               <p>Their ſecond Maxime is, To enter into all ſorts of Affairs either by right or wrong, and everywhere to make themſelves the Arbiters either by vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence or by cunning, by Authoritie or by ſurprize, by threatnings or by friendſhip, and to get in as Mediators even into thoſe Treaties of Peace wherein they are intereſſed as Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; as they pretended to doe in that of the Biſhop of <hi>Munſter,</hi> and do
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:101549:157"/>actually practiſe in the Aſſembly at <hi>Breda.</hi> In all the Differences, either paſt or preſent, they have never doubted to take Partie; there never yet was Quarrell in which they had not dexteritie enough to form unto themſelves ſome kind of Intereſt, and ſome Rights; nor did ever any People ſhew the leaſt inclination towards Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, but inſtantly they made them their Allies. But experience hath made it viſible, that they never entred into any War but to exaſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate it, nor into any Peace but to ſow the ſeeds of new Diſputes. It would be ſuperfluous to number them, ſince there is no body ſo little verſed in the ancient Story who does not confeſs this truth, and that the modern Examples have made us know it ſufficiently. In the laſt Troubles of <hi>Germanie,</hi> into which they thruſt themſelves at firſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the colour of Protection, with a thouſand ſpecious proteſtations that they would never pretend any thing for themſelves, but barely the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:101549:157"/>of their Allies; when the buſineſs came to its full Criſis, they diſmembred <hi>Alſatia</hi> from the Body of the Empire, by the ſame Artifice with which they had diſſolved from it<note n="*" place="margin">Metz, Toul, <hi>and</hi> Verdun.</note> three Biſhopricks under the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the Third.</p>
               <p>The third Maxime is, To have for their onely Rule the Intereſt of State, ſo that the Faith of Treaties, the good of Religion, or the ties of Bloud and Amitie cannot hold them. 'Tis this that the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> puts for the fundamental Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of all his Work; <hi>The Princes command over the People, Intereſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands over Princes.</hi> All that the <hi>Turks</hi> have done in Chriſtendom ſince <hi>Francis</hi> the Firſt to our time, they owe it to the Alliances of the Crown of <hi>France</hi> with the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Port, and to the Diverſions which they have made in their favour againſt all thoſe who have deſired to undertake ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing againſt this Common Enemy. And though that the Proteſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is beholding to it for a part of
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:101549:158"/>its progreſs; yet <hi>France</hi> doth not therefore deſiſt from giving ſecret in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligences to the Catholicks, to make them conſider its power, as the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, which being tied by no Capitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, is therefore in a condition to reduce all Sects under the Obedience of the Church. In a word, for the erection of their Monarchie, they do imitate and apply to ill uſes the Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ime which St. <hi>Paul</hi> practiſed for the enlarging of the Kingdom of <hi>Chriſt, Factus ſum omnibus omnia:</hi> and as this Apoſtle complied with all ſorts of ſpirits to gain them to the Church, weeping with the afflicted, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king part in the conſolation of thoſe which he found to be ſatisfied; theſe, by a wrong Imitation of this holy Conduct, conform themſelves to the Intereſts of all the World, to make them ſerve theirs, and ſacrifice Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion as often as it comes in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition with the Intereſt of State. The examples are ſo freſh, that we need not make any enumeration of them: and many things might be
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:101549:158"/>ſaid on this ſubject, in reference to the laſt War againſt the <hi>Turks,</hi> if Modeſty did not oblige us to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs them.</p>
               <p>Their fourth Maxime is, To keep as much as they can forrein States occupied and divided at home, or elſe engaged in ſome external War. <hi>England,</hi> the Empire, <hi>Italie, Denmark</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> have had a ſad Experience of this; and now both <hi>Poland</hi> and the States of the United Provinces do reſent the deplorable effects thereof.</p>
               <p>All theſe Maximes are proper to Conquerours, and as many infallible marks of a vaſt and profound De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign long ago contrived. The Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors of the moſt Chriſtian King could not bring it to perfection, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Civil Wars, the power of <hi>Spain,</hi> and the juſt Limits which the Royal Authoritie then acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, were powerful Barrs to ſtop them: but at preſent, having impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed at home an abſolute Law over all their Subjects, and having put Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſention
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:101549:159"/>amongſt all Strangers, there remains nothing but that they over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the third Impediment, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleating the overthrow of the Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie of <hi>Spain,</hi> that they may paſs upon our Ruines to the Conqueſt of all the other States. To attain this, it was neceſſary they ſhould full us aſleep with the Aſſurances of Peace, and Propoſitions of Leagues and U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion: The War of <hi>Portugal</hi> was care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to be nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, to conſume by a ſlow fire this Monarchie, and keep at the ſame time <hi>Portugal</hi> in their Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencie, by the neceſſity of their Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance: A War muſt be raiſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed by a thouſand Artifices, to get themſelves elbow-room to Invade the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> whilſt theſe two great Powers ſhould be drowned in Bloud to their reciprocal Ruine. It was held requiſite to ſow the Seeds of Diviſion in the Empire by the means of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Leagues, which, under colour of the Good of the Peace of <hi>Germany,</hi> have no other End then to facilitate
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:101549:159"/>the Invaſion of it, and hinder Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance to be given to one of its moſt precious Members. A powerfull Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on likewiſe was to be raiſed in <hi>Poland,</hi> to keep all the Princes of the North under check, and a part of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour's Forces unuſefully imployed in the Gard of his Frontiers. To ſeem indifferent to both Religions, it was neceſſary one while to aſſiſt the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor of <hi>Mentz</hi> againſt thoſe of <hi>Erfort,</hi> and then the Elector <hi>Palatine</hi> againſt <hi>Mentz;</hi> and to ſeek everywhere their Advantages in the Troubles of others.</p>
               <p>I cannot here omit one freſh Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple which makes much to my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, though I foreſee that it will oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion as much horrour in the Reader as it hath done to my own Pen. <hi>France,</hi> by virtue of a Treatie of Warrantie with the States of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Provinces, after divers unuſefull Requisitions made by the ſaid States, found her ſelf at laſt obliged, by her Intereſt, to make ſome ſhew of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to imbrace their Defence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>England.</hi> This Treatie of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocal
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:101549:160"/>Warrantie expreſly contains, that the Allies ſhould not ſo much as treat, and much leſs conclude any Peace with the Common Enemie, or Truce, without the conſent of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>and without procuring the ſame Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction for their Allie which he ſhould obtain for himſelf.</hi> The States of the United Provinces did ſo ſcrupulouſly adhere to this Obligation, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the little Reality of the <hi>French</hi> Succours againſt <hi>England,</hi> and the conſiderable Advantages which they could have found by Treating apart, they would never lend an ear unto any Propoſition of this nature. <hi>France,</hi> on the contrary, alwaies held a Negotiation open by the means of the Earl of <hi>S. Albans:</hi> and upon the juſt Suſpicions which they gave unto the ſaid States, by the frequent goings and comings, and the flux and reflux of Courriers, continually paſſing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Paris</hi> and <hi>London,</hi> the Court of <hi>France</hi> did ſo authentickly confirm to them their Faith, and gave them ſo poſitive words, that they would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:101549:160"/>hearken to any Propoſition but in the common Aſſembly for the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Peace between all the Allies, that even they ordained the Count <hi>de l'Eſtrade,</hi> that in caſe credit were not given to what he aſſured in the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Embaſſadour, ſo good an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion have they of the honeſty of their Miniſterie) he might deveſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of his Character, to aſſure them of it in his own name. A great ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour indeed for Monſieur <hi>de l'Eſtrade,</hi> which ſhews that he is not capable of deceiving but in the quality of a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of <hi>France,</hi> and that the Probity of his Perſon exalts the Dignity of his Charge. Notwithſtanding, if he had been ſo unadviſed as to have engaged himſelf in this Surety, he would at this day have found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf liable both to the Principal and the Intereſt; it being out of doubt that <hi>England</hi> hath had the dexterity to engage <hi>France</hi> in this Quagmire, to conclude a ſecret Treatie of Peace with them without the Conſent, nay without the Knowledge, of their Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:101549:161"/>without making any mention of them or of their Intereſts, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any reſervation of or relation to the General Peace. But that which is yet more aſtoniſhing is, that after this Peace was concluded, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Promiſe made to the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> not to uſe any Hoſtility againſt them, <hi>France</hi> uſed all its endeavours with the States of the United Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to put out their Fleet ſpeedily to Sea, binding themſelves to joyn their own Fleet with it, and agreeing with them upon all the Conditions neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for this effect. If this procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding doth not open the eyes or all <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi> they'l have no cauſe to complain of the Calamities which they are to ſuffer by <hi>France,</hi> which takes ſo much pains to undeceive them.</p>
               <p>All the Maximes which I have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove related are thoſe of Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours; but their manner of executing them is ſo much the more to be fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as it conſiſts altogether in Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Activity, and that no Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Juſtice, nor any Condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:101549:161"/>to the Interpoſition of Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and of their own Allies, is able to ſtop the current of it. It is no more now the fear nor the jealouſie of the Power of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> which ſerved them for a Pretext in their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Wars, that makes them act at this day; they dare no longer make uſe of that ridiculous Scarecrow of the Univerſal Monarchie aimed at by the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> they have no occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from the Diſcontents of the Proteſtants of <hi>Germanie,</hi> and their Alliances with the United Provinces; they can no longer cloak with the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of others the Itch which they have to conquer: there remained no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe for them to doe, but to goe ſeek the occaſions of War in the very Sanctuary of Peace, and to form the project of it upon a Marriage, which they themſelves do avow was made for no other End but to render the Union eternal and inſeparable.</p>
               <p>It may be judged by all this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, that theſe great Deſigns muſt needs have a vaſter Idea then the
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:101549:162"/>Conqueſt of the <hi>Low-Countries;</hi> that they are the firſt attaqued as the Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works, to the end they may lodge themſelves without impediment in the Body of the place they have Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to, <hi>the greateſt part of Gemanie,</hi> as an ancient Domain of <hi>France,</hi> which could not be alienated. They are going to form to themſelves a Precedent againſt the States of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> by the Annulling of all the Royal Surrenders, and the Eſtabliſhment of the Devolution. They covet Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours in <hi>Spain,</hi> Leagues in the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, Factions in <hi>Poland,</hi> Wars in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> Paſſes into <hi>Italie,</hi> and the Sovereign Arbitrage every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where. Their Quiet conſiſts in the Trouble of all others, their Glory in Conqueſts, and their Advantage in the publick Calamities. In this they follow their ſole and ſupreme Rule of Intereſt. It is the part of all others to take their meaſures from this, and to think ſeriouſly of proſecuting their own.</p>
               <p>There remains ſomething to be ſaid
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:101549:162"/>of the particular Obligation of the Empire for the Defence of the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of <hi>Burgundie.</hi> I ſhall paſs but lightly over this matter, becauſe it is already decided by a ſolemn Act of the Chancerie of the Empire; and that he who hath written on this Point at <hi>Ratisbon</hi> hath penetrated in few words ſo throughly into the Bottom of this Affair, and ſo drained it, that he hath left nothing to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, no more then to be replied thereto. In effect, I never read any thing more cold nor weak then the Anſwer which was long ſince publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the behalf of <hi>France</hi> againſt this ſolid Writing: It is filled with an unuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full heap of words, ſhuns the Liſts everywhere, ſtrays from the Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, omits the principal Objections, and ſuppoſes the Point ſtill in contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie to be a thing already proved. It inlarges it ſelf into great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, becauſe by this Writing it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears as if people would doubt that the moſt Chriſtian King had a deſign to Invade the Circle of <hi>Burgundie.</hi>
                  <pb n="302" facs="tcp:101549:163"/>They could not more palpablie mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt the Injuſtice of this War, then by taking for an Injurie the bare Suſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion which we conceived thereof. But what will he ſay at preſent, when all <hi>Europe</hi> ſees that our Fears were a prudent Foreſight, and that the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent hath verified our Conjectures? Can he to day make that paſs for an act of Juſtice, which he deteſted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as an Attempt which we could not ſo much as foreſee without offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them? Will he not bluſh for ſhame at the Exclamation which he hath made, <hi>Aut quaſi Chriſtianiſſima Regia Majeſtas in animo haberet eundem Circulum denuo Armis aggredi, &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vadere?</hi> It was then a Crime but to think that this could happen; and now it is a greater, it ſeems, with them, to wonder that it is come to paſs.</p>
               <p>But in the end, no man doubts but that the Circle of <hi>Burgundie</hi> is a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Empire: the Authour of this Anſwer grants it to be ſo himſelf, and thus diſpenſes with my pains to prove it.</p>
               <pb n="303" facs="tcp:101549:163"/>
               <p>He knoweth alſo that as ſuch it is obliged to aſſiſt the Body in caſe of neceſſitie, and all the Members of the Empire, and to furniſh its proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Contributions which are neceſſary to the Defence thereof; which the King hath exactly and ſuperabundantly accompliſhed on all ſorts of occaſions, both before and after the Treatie of <hi>Munſter.</hi> And by the rule of Law, he that is obliged to all the Charges, ought likewiſe to participate of all the Advantages: o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe the Union of this Circle with the Empire would be a Leonine Societie. All the World knows that this Warrantie is reciprocall, and that it muſt equally hold on both ſides; ſo that he who is bound to ſuccour the Empire againſt all, and on all manner of occaſions, ought alſo to receive the mutual Aſſiſtance of the Empire againſt all thoſe who do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade him.</p>
               <p>It is likewiſe certain, that by the Treatie of <hi>Munſter</hi> it is included in that Peace as a Circle of the Empire,
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:101549:164"/>and that by this incluſion it ought to enjoy all the Rights and Prerogatives which appertain to the other Circles, and all the effects of the Peace, by which the common and reciprocal Defence is eſtabliſhed.</p>
               <p>Againſt which they have nothing to oppoſe but an Article ill under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, and worſe interpreted, of the Treatie of <hi>Munſter, de mutuis Hoſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus non juvandis,</hi> by which the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire and <hi>France</hi> do reciprocally ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige themſelves not to give any Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance to their reſpective Enemies.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>France</hi> hath directly contravened this Article by the Aſſiſtance which ſhe ſent againſt the Biſhop of <hi>Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> which effectually did enter into the Lands of the Empire; and by the Counſel ſhe gave to reduce this Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoprick into Aſhes,</p>
               <p>But for the better underſtanding of this Article, we muſt obſerve that it is concluded betwixt the Bodie of the Empire indiviſibly on the one part, &amp; <hi>France</hi> on the other, which do reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procally promiſe not to aſſiſt the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:101549:164"/>of each other. Here the Empire with all its Members is rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned but one Partie contracting, and <hi>France</hi> the other: ſo that when it is ſaid that it ſhall not aſſiſt the Enemies of <hi>France,</hi> it ſhould be underſtood of Enemies abroad, and cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the Members of the Empire, which in one Body are the ſame Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which have treated with her, and to which all the Body owes defence, by an original, natural, and undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſable obligation. Were this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe underſtood, it might be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred by the ſame Argument, that in caſe the Empire did aſſault any Province belonging to the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> the other Provinces of the ſame Realm could not go to their Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance without violating the Article <hi>de non juvandis Hoſtibus.</hi> If <hi>France</hi> doth replie, that thoſe Provinces make up but one Kingdom, we ſhall alſo ſay, that the Ten Circles do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute but one Empire; ſo that when <hi>France</hi> hath War with any one Circle of the Empire, it is a War made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:101549:165"/>the whole Body: And the word <hi>mutui hoſtes</hi> cannot be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted but of Strangers; elſe the Body of the Empire had obliged it ſelf not to aſſiſt its Members againſt <hi>France,</hi> and by conſequence to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don it ſelf, and to ſee it ſelf diſmem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred by parcells, while the Parts of this great Body ſhould not dare to ſtretch forth their hands to the help of one another. But in this caſe it is not to give Aſſiſtance to the Enemies of <hi>France,</hi> but it is to defend the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire againſt <hi>France,</hi> which doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade it. If this Clauſe, <hi>de mutuis Hoſtibus non juvandis,</hi> be univerſal, and do comprehend all thoſe with whom <hi>France</hi> hath any debate, it would operate againſt all the other Circles, as well as that of <hi>Burgundie,</hi> and there ſhall be no Member of the Empire which may hope for any Relief from the other Circles in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to the Invaſions of <hi>France.</hi> But if they will apply it particularly to the Circle of <hi>Burgundie,</hi> they muſt prove, by the ſame Inſtrument of
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:101549:165"/>Peace, that although it be a Member of the Empire, it is of the number of thoſe Enemies which it cannot aſſiſt againſt <hi>France;</hi> and that the other Circles are excepted out of this ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Rule, or that they have ſome particular Privilege above that of <hi>Burgundie.</hi> But neither the Treatie of Peace nor the Imperial Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions making it to be in a worſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition then the others, and on the contrary including it in the ſame Peace and the ſame Rights which the other Circles do enjoy; it follows, that the Clauſe <hi>de non juvandis Hoſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus</hi> ought to be extended to the Ten Circles, or that it ought not to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend that of <hi>Burgundie.</hi> The Imperial Capitulation, which is formed upon the Idea of the ſame Treatie of Peace, doth yet more clearly explicate all the Doubts which may be raiſed touching a truth ſo palpable, by the reſervation of the Article of Warrantie contained in the Inſtrument of Peace: which ſhews clearly that the Obligation not
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:101549:166"/>to aſſiſt the Enemies of <hi>France</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not derogate from that which all the Circles of the Empire have recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally to aſſiſt each other. All that the Writer of <hi>France</hi> alledges againſt this in his Anſwer is but a frothed Cream, and is ſo ſtrongly refuted in the Replie which of late hath come to light, that it were loſt labour to endeavour to give it any farther clearing.</p>
               <p>The Electors, Princes and States of the Empire, are fully perſuaded of theſe Truths; they are not unſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of the Contempt done to their Juriſdiction openly violated by this Attempt; they are not blind to the Dangers which threaten them by our Oppreſſion: but as they never go from the ways of Moderation, they would not imitate <hi>France,</hi> by begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, after their Example, the Proceſs by the Execution, judging that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoved them to try the means of Gentleneſs, Reaſon, and Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrances, firſt, before they ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre to the laſt remedie. But they

In effect, to the Suſpenſion of Arms which they have propoſed, they have had no Return but that of a diſdainful Refuſal; to the Mediation which they offered, a doubtful Hope; and to the Time and Place of the Treatie, a Silence full of Artifice. They will ſee full Commiſſions before they declare themſelves as to other circumſtances, which (according to the order of all Treaties) neceſſarily ought to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede the ſending of Plenipotentia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries: They take great care to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade that our Queen hath cut off all kind of approches to an Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation: They do of purpoſe conceal from their Deputies her laſt Anſwer, by which ſhe offers to ſend her Embaſſadors to the place which
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:101549:167"/>ſhall be agreed on, and to refer all to the Arbitration of the Mediators which ſhould be choſen. They will have nothing of all this: a full Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er muſt needs precede, without knowing whither the Plenipotentia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries ſhall be ſent, or to whom they will refer themſelves. So ſoon as this ſhall be conſigned, they'l form Scruples upon every ſyllable; if there wants onely a <hi>Comma, Spain</hi> ſhall be preſently judged as an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie to the Peace. In the mean time they go on always gaining ground, they render from day to day the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamitie more incurable; and whilſt they labour by this Juggling to ſtop the juſt Aſſiſtance of the Empire and of the other Princes, the progreſs of their Arms advances without check, and they labour to put themſelves in a condition to render all thoſe Helps unprofitable which juſtly we may expect, and to deal ſo, that our Friends ſhall not be undeceived, till their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours can no longer hinder our Ruine.</p>

               <p>The onely Remedie is, quickly to imbrace Maximes proper for coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining theirs. They have a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome united in all the Parts of it; let us unite our Affections and Powers. Their Quietneſs depends upon our Trouble; let us ſeek our Safetie by the abating of their Pride. They act by way of Fact; let us repell Force by Force. They dallie with us by vain hopes of Peace; let us put our ſelves in a condition to make them deſire it ſeriouſly. In a word, they have a deſign upon us all: let us make then of this Cauſe a Common Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, and not anchor all our Deliverie upon the favour of the <hi>Cyclop;</hi> which was indeed profitable to <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes,</hi> but by a good fortune which in reaſon he ought not to have expected.</p>
